JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): President-elect Trump heads to the White House after an earthquake election few expected.



DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division.



TAPPER: Some say, not so fast, as protesters take to the streets in uproar.



UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: Not my president!



TAPPER: What will Donald Trump's America and his White House look like? Top adviser and potential Cabinet pick Rudy Giuliani will be here.



Plus, Trump made big campaign promises, from Obamacare.



TRUMP: Repealing and replacing Obamacare.



TAPPER: To immigration.



TRUMP: There will be no amnesty.



TAPPER: And, of course:



TRUMP: We will build a great wall.



TAPPER: But he seems to be already backing off some of his signature lines. What will really get done? And can he work with Congress? An exclusive interview with House Speaker Paul Ryan.



Plus, Clinton concedes.



HILLARY CLINTON (D), FMR. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for.



TAPPER: As Democrats lick their wounds.



CLINTON: I'm not going to sugarcoat it. These have been very, very tough days. TAPPER: Should they have seen it coming? Michael Moore did -- what he says liberals must do now.



Plus, the best political minds will be here with insights on this historic election.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



TAPPER: Hello. I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, where the state of our union is in transition.



Donald Trump is now president-elect Trump. And the world is watching with bated breath to see just what he has in store for America. Protests against his election, of course, continue this weekend across the country, most of them peaceful, although the mayor of Portland, Oregon, is asking protesters to stand down in the wake of violence against police in that city.



There are some reports of violence against Trump supporters. In Connecticut, two men were arrested for allegedly beating a man holding a Trump sign. Meanwhile, civil rights groups in school districts across the country report an uptick in incidents of intimidation and harassment of minority groups and girls and women.



Graffiti in North Carolina reads: ""Black lives doesn't matter and neither does your votes.""



""Go back to Africa. Make America great again"" was written in a high school bathroom in Minnesota.



Tensions are high and tempers are flaring across the country. The country, of course, may be divided, but the government in Washington, D.C., is not. Republicans now control the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate, and, soon, the White House.



So what is on the Trump agenda and how quickly can it get done?



(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)



TAPPER: Joining me now from Janesville, Wisconsin, is House Speaker Paul Ryan.



Mr. Speaker, thanks so much for joining us.



Before we begin talking about legislation and moving forward, I'm just wondering, there are millions of Americans out there, as I'm sure you know, who are frankly terrified about what this America under President Trump will mean for them.



Is there anything that you, as speaker of the House, one of the leaders of the nation, want to say to them?



REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Sure.



First of all, I hate it that people feel this way. And, second of all, they should not. I think people should be rest assured. America is a pluralistic, inclusive country. It has, it has been, and it will continue to be.



So, I really think that people should put their minds at ease. We're going to get to work on solving the big country's problems, getting this economy growing, fixing our national security, you know, fixing our health care problems, getting our budget put together, the things that we have been talking about.



So, I think people should just really put their minds at ease. We are pluralistic. We're inclusive. That's the kind of country we want. That's the country we are. And that's the country we're still going to have.



TAPPER: But just to accept and acknowledge that there are these incidents taking place all over the country...



RYAN: Well, first, yes, I heard your lead-in there. That's terrible. That's awful.



By the way, that's not Republicans. We are the party of Lincoln. People who espouse those views, they're not Republicans. And we don't want them in our party, even if they're thinking about it. And I'm confident Donald Trump feels the same way.



So, there's no place for that. And protests, as long as protests are peaceful, if people want to express themselves that way, that's what we can do in this country. That's what the First Amendment is all about.



TAPPER: Let's move forward to some of the action items.



Obviously, repealing and replacing Obamacare is one of the big items that president-elect Trump and you want to tackle. President-elect Trump recently said there are elements of Obamacare he wants to keep. This is what he to say to ""60 Minutes."" Take a listen.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



QUESTION: Let me does you about Obamacare, which you say you're going to repeal and replace. When you replace it, are you going to make sure that people with preconditions are still covered?



[09:05:01]



TRUMP: Yes, because it happens to be one of the -- strongest asset.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



TAPPER: Now, your Better Way agenda talks about spending $25 billion on high-risk pools that would help those with preexisting conditions afford insurance. Where would that $25 billion come from?



RYAN: Well, we actually have it paid for in our bill. You really want me to give you a technical answer to this? It gets a little technical.



The point is, we have in our plan pay for doing that. Here's the bigger point, Jake. We agree. It's in our plan. Donald Trump agrees with this. We need to have a solution for people with preexisting conditions.



In our plan is allowing younger people up to the age of 26 to stay on their parents' plan. So, there are aspects that we have all along agreed to.



TAPPER: Under Obamacare, as you know, millions of people were able to get health insurance for the first time through the expansion of Medicaid.



What is going happen to those people? Will they lose coverage under your plan?



RYAN: Well, if you go -- what I encourage people to do is go to Better.GOP. It's number five on our plan. We put the most detail out of anybody that has put out an Obamacare replacement plan.



And it is to have an answer for everyone with preexisting conditions, people who are the uninsured. The point I would say is this, Jake. We can have a health care system in America where everyone, regardless of income or health condition, can get affordable health insurance, get affordable health care.



This is what we propose. We think a patient-centered system is the right way to do that. And you can have the system without a costly government takeover, like Obamacare, that is cranking up premiums, that is making deductibles so high. Doesn't even feel like you have health insurance. Obamacare is failing. It must replaced.



We're going to do that. We're excited about it. And the point I would put people's minds at ease is, we can fix these problems. We can fix what was broken in health care without breaking what was working in health care. And that's exactly what we're proposing.



And if you want to get any level of detail on this, just go to Better.GOP and see what we have already offered.



TAPPER: Well, as you know, the Medicaid expansion is providing government-paid health insurance to individuals. I mean, that's what it does. So, if you repeal Obamacare, does it repeal also the Medicaid expansion, or would that part of it stay?



RYAN: For example, we propose to replace that with refundable tax credits for people to buy affordable health care insurance.



So, the kinds of reforms that we're talking about will lower the cost of insurance itself. And then a person would have, such as our proposal calls for, a refundable tax credit, like a voucher, to go buy health insurance.



That's much cheaper, much more affordable. And, more importantly, you get to buy what you want to buy, not what the government is making you buy.



TAPPER: Obamacare also provides birth control to women at no cost. Is that going to end or will that remain?



RYAN: Look, I'm not going to get into all the nitty-gritty details of these things.



TAPPER: With all do respect, I don't know that the average woman of child-bearing years out there who relies upon contraception provided by health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act, I don't know that she would think that that's just a nitty-gritty detail. That's...



RYAN: You're asking me detail...



TAPPER: Well, what do you think? Is it important to you?



RYAN: Jake, you're asking me details about legislation -- you're asking me details about legislation that hasn't been written yet.



(CROSSTALK)



TAPPER: Right. But is it important to you? Would that be a principle? Would that be a principle of whatever replaces it, because...



RYAN: I'm not going to get into -- I'm not going to get into hypotheticals about legislation that hasn't even been drafted yet.



TAPPER: Let me ask you a question about improving security at the border. You and Donald Trump both agree you want to improve security at the border. You obviously have different views when it comes to the 10 to 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States.



This is what you said to say back in April during a town hall at Georgetown University:



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



RYAN: I'm a person who believes that, for the undocumented, we have to come up with a solution that doesn't involve mass deportation, that involves giving people the ability to get right with the law to come and earn a legal status while we fix the rest of legal immigration.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



TAPPER: Now take a listen to what president-elect Trump said on ""Morning Joe"" last year.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, ""MORNING JOE"")



TRUMP: We're going to have a deportation force. And you're going to do it humanely



QUESTION: How are you going to pay for this?



TRUMP: It's very inexpensive.



QUESTION: Are they going to be ripped out of their homes? How?



TRUMP: Can I tell you, they're going back where they came. If they came from a certain country, they're going to be brought back to that country. That's the way it's supposed to be.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



TAPPER: So, Congress writes the laws and controls the purse strings



Is there going to be mass deportation or not? And this isn't just a nitty-gritty detail. There are millions of people who are very worried about this.



RYAN: Sure. Sure.



And I think we should put people's minds at ease. That is not what our focus is. That is not what we're focused on. We're focused on securing the border.



We think that's first and foremost. Before we get into any other immigration issue, we have got to know who's coming and going in the country. We have got to secure the border. So, we believe an enforcement bill, a border security enforcement bill, is really the first priority. And that's what we're focused on.



TAPPER: OK, so it's not a top priority, mass deportation. But, obviously, president-elect Trump thinks it is.



RYAN: No, securing the border is our...



TAPPER: Right.



RYAN: Securing the border is our top priority.



TAPPER: Right, but about what in year two, year three, year four?



RYAN: That's why I'm saying we're not focused on -- we are not planning on erecting a deportation force. Donald Trump's not planning on that.



[09:10:03]



TAPPER: Well, let me ask you, and does the fact that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, does that impact in any way your sense of mandate or how far you should be willing to go, considering that the woman who lost actually got more votes?



RYAN: I'd say two things.



Look at the expectations going into this. Look at what all the public polling said. Look at what all the prognosticators were saying like the day of the election. He beat all the odds.



Look, what I think people need to stop doing is stop underestimating Donald Trump. A lot of us did that. I think he's very much of the mind-set that there is a need to unify this country, to heal the division in this country, but also there's a mandate and a desire and a commitment to fix the problems as we have laid the solutions out.



So, we all laid out very concrete solutions for why we need to get this country back on track. We're now going to implement the solutions. And we think this is good. We think this is going to help people get out of poverty. We think this is going to grow the economy, make our country more secure, make our border secure, help the military go on offense against ISIS, clean up the red tape that is strangling small businesses, so they can hire people again.



These are good things that we have in store that we're really excited about getting to work on doing for the American people.



TAPPER: One of the things that you don't mention -- and I can certainly understand why -- when you talk about the path forward with president-elect Trump is one of the biggest differences between yourself and Donald Trump policy-wise, having to do with the issue of trade.



In his contract with the American voter, he promised in his 100 days to establish tariffs to discourage companies from laying off workers. Will you pass those tariffs in your first 100 days?



RYAN: Well, I think there's a better way of dealing with that particular issue.



And if you go to number six on our Better Way agenda and you look at the tax reform, this is something that Donald also talked about during the campaign, which is to fix our taxes on border adjustments, which we believe is a smarter way, which is what all the other countries, which is not tariffs, not trade wars.



So, we think there are better ways of dealing with making American products and workers more competitive, and really it's fixing our tax code.



TAPPER: Throughout the campaign, as you know, president-elect Trump talked about tariffs. It could be as high as 35 percent, 45 percent.



RYAN: Yes.



TAPPER: If he comes to you and says, this is what we're doing, what are you going say?



RYAN: The point I'm trying to make is, I think we can achieve what he's trying -- he's trying to make America more competitive. He's trying to make the American worker more competitive. He's trying to make it so that American businesses stay in America.



And we believe the smartest and best way to do that is comprehensive tax reform, which actually makes America much more competitive without any adverse effects, without any collateral damage to the economy.



TAPPER: A minute ago, you were talking about how Donald Trump, the president-elect, expressed concerned to you he wanted to -- or expressed a desire to you that he wanted to unify the country. On that note, I want to turn to staffing at the Trump White House. A



lot of people, including many conservatives, are concerned that Steve Bannon, who is the CEO of the Trump campaign and the chief executive of Breitbart News, that he used Breitbart News to, in their view, the view of conservatives, the view of Republicans, to mainstream white supremacist views, anti-Semitic views, racist views.



Do you have any concerns about Steve Bannon being in the White House?



RYAN: No, I don't have concerns. I have never met the guy. I don't know Steve Bannon, so I have no concerns.



I believe -- I trust Donald's judgment. I think he's going to pick who he thinks will best serve him. And I'm sure we will work well with whoever his chief of staff is, whoever his staff is.



So, I believe that Donald is going to have a great set of choices to make for staffing. I'm also very own encouraged by the fact that my friend, a great conservative from -- a man whose shown he's a true leader, Mike Pence, is going to be running the transition team.



So, I think between Pence running the transition team -- look, Donald is a multibillionaire who has had lots of companies, who has run extremely successful businesses. So, he's done things like this before. He's staffed up. He's run major organizations. He's a successful person. He surrounds himself with successful people.



So, I'm confident he's going to do the same here.



TAPPER: You sound very optimistic and positive about him, but during the campaign, you said that one of the things he said about Judge Curiel fit the textbook definition of racism.



RYAN: Look, I'm not going to relitigate the past. I'm looking for the future.



And I want I mean when I say unifying, getting people back to work, fixing welfare so people -- fixing welfare so people can go from welfare to work, replacing this horrible health care law that is really hurting families, putting health care providers out of business, and replacing it with patient-centered health care, rebuilding our national security so we're safe again, cleaning up the regulatory state, following the Constitution.



I mean, these are all good things for our country that we are now working on putting in place the plan to do just that. That's transformational. That's positive. That's good.



[09:15:01]



TAPPER: The pride of Janesville, House Speaker Paul Ryan, thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate it.



RYAN: All right, thank you Jake. Take care.



(END VIDEOTAPE) TAPPER: The Trump transition team has been huddled inside Trump Tower all weekend as they work to create an administration, Cabinet nominees, White House staff.



Kellyanne Conway telling reports yesterday that Trump's choice for chief of staff is imminent. That and other picks could tell us a lot about how president-elect Trump plans to govern.



Let's talk about the new Trump administration with top adviser Rudy Giuliani, who is himself rumored to be a contender for several top jobs.



Mr. Mayor, thanks for joining us. And congratulations.



RUDY GIULIANI (R), FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK: Thank you, Jake.



TAPPER: So, I know you're not going to answer...



GIULIANI: Thank you very, very much, Jake.



TAPPER: I know you're not going to answer any questions I have about what jobs you're being considered for.



(LAUGHTER)



TAPPER: So, let me just set that aside.



There's a big issue...



GIULIANI: Thank you.



(LAUGHTER)



TAPPER: There's a big issue at play here as you prepare for the Trump administration.



I know you're more than cognizant of the fact that Donald Trump has hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars in businesses and business interests around the nation and throughout the world. During the campaign, he was asked what he would do with his businesses if he won.



Take a listen.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



TRUMP: If I become president, I couldn't care less about my company. It's peanuts. I have Ivanka and Eric and Don sitting there.



Run the company, kids. Have a good time. I'm going to do it for America, OK?



(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)



TRUMP: So, I would be willing to...



QUESTION: So, you will put your assets in a blind trust?



TRUMP: I would put it in a blind trust.



Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don, and Eric run it, but -- is that a blind trust? I don't know.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



TAPPER: I will answer that question. That's not a blind trust. If your kids run your businesses, it's not a blind trust.



In a blind trust, there is an independent trustee who takes over your portfolio and directs it without your input or any input from anyone around you.



Do you think that to avoid any conflicts of interest, not to many questions by the public as to whether he's making decisions at least in part for his own financial reasons, do you think it would be best for Mr. Trump to set up a true blind trust with no involvement from him or his kids?



GIULIANI: Well, first of all, you realize that those laws don't apply to the president, right? So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust. For some reason, when the law was written, the president was exempt.



I think he's in a very unusual situation. He would basically put his children out of work if -- and they'd have to go start a whole new business, and that would set up the whole -- set up new problems.



So, it would seem to me that if he set up a situation in which the children were running it, there was a legal or clear document that meant that he would not be involved, he would have no interest in it, he would have no input into it, he would just have a passive interest, that would be the kind of thing that would work here.



It's kind of unrealistic to say, you're going to take the business away from the three people who are running it, and give it to some independent person. And, remember, they can't work in the government because of the government rule against nepotism.



So, you would be putting them out of work. So, I think you're going to have to fashion something that is very comfortable, something that's fair, something that assures the American people, as he said, he has no interest in what's going on in the business, and that his children get to run the business they know how to run.



TAPPER: Right.



GIULIANI: And stay out of all government matters.



TAPPER: Well, but, Mr. Mayor, I mean, his children are -- as I don't need to tell you, they are a huge part of his advisory committee. They are advising the transition, Ivanka, Don Jr., and Eric.



Jared Kushner, Ivanka's husband, is being talked about as coming on board and working at the White House, even if he's not paid for it.



If he does not set up a truly blind trust, how can the American people have confidence that, when he makes a decision, that he isn't at least partly making it to enrich himself?



GIULIANI: Well, even if he turned it over to an independent trustee and it was the Trump Corporation, you can't -- I mean, there's no perfect way to do this.



You have to have some confidence in the integrity of the president. The man is an enormously wealthy man. I don't think there's any real fear of suspicion that he's seeking to enrich himself by being president. If he wanted to enrich himself, he wouldn't have run for president.



So, I think there can be a way to do this. And, by the way, Jared Kushner has his own company, completely independent of Trump, that is a very, very successful real estate company. He's maybe, you know, one of the biggest in New York. He -- so, Jared is a kind of different, different situation.



TAPPER: Well, I will just say this. And then you can dismiss it as you want. But I'm putting a flag in it right now.



If a blind trust is not set up, this is going to be Donald Trump for the duration of his presidency, because every decision he makes, whether it's the pipeline in North Dakota, or business relationships in Turkey, everything is going to be under the lens of, well, what is the effect of this on his wealth and his family's wealth?



[09:20:07]



I get that you think that that's not a consideration or not as serious a consideration as...



GIULIANI: No, no, no.



What I'm telling you is, the blind trust solution isn't much better, meaning an independent trustee would run it. And any decision that he made, even if he didn't know it, that helped him, somebody would run it down and say, oh, my goodness, he may have made it for that reason.



So, blind trusts aren't perfect either. This is a very special kind of situation.



TAPPER: I think it's far better than -- it's far better than people in his family advising him and then also working on his business. I think...



GIULIANI: But they're not -- once he gets into government, they will not be -- they will not be -- they will not be advising him.



There will be -- there will have to be a wall -- there will have to be a wall between them with regard to government matters and something I'm very familiar with from my days in the Justice Department, which is recusing yourself from decisions that involve you or any financial matter involving you.



TAPPER: All right.



Well, if you thought the issues between the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton's State Department were big, fasten your seat belts. But let's move on.



Mr. Trump shook up the Republican primary by...



GIULIANI: Oh, I think, I think, Jake, Jake, Jake, I think that's a very unfair suggestion.



There, you were talking about enormous amounts of cash. I'm counting up to about $230 million that went for specific actions like talking to the IRS. And I don't -- I don't see that happening in a Trump administration.



This man didn't run for president because he wants to get rich. He's rich already.



TAPPER: All right.



GIULIANI: So, I don't think you're going to have that happen unless you try to make it happen.



TAPPER: All right.



Mr. Trump shook up the Republican primary back in December when he made this promise. Take a listen.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



TRUMP: Donald J. Trump is calling all and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is doing on.



(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)



(END VIDEO CLIP)



TAPPER: So, just a simple question. Is that policy still operative?



GIULIANI: Well, you know, twice, you used things that he changed during the campaign. He did say that. That is correct.



Actually, within a day or two of his saying that, he called me and asked me to put a little group together that included Congressman McCaul, General Flynn -- I can't remember who else, a few other people. We wrote a paper for him. And he amended it to the ban would be restricted to particular countries, and it would not be a ban.



It would involve extreme vetting. The one -- the one place in which he would not let anyone in, unless it was an extraordinary circumstance, would be Syrian refugees. All the rest from countries that contain dangerous populations of radical Islamic extremists, he will subject them to extreme vetting, but not a ban. So, he said that about 100 times during the campaign from the time



that he made that -- from the time that he made that statement.



TAPPER: Yes, he said that was an expansion.



GIULIANI: So, you can go back.



TAPPER: He said it was an expansion of his original proposal.



But let's talk about what you're talking about, specifically, Mr. Trump wanting to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur and also extreme vetting.



Back in June, when Senator Jeff Sessions, a strong supporter and adviser of president-elect Trump, when Senator Sessions was on the program, he identified six countries that might fall into that category, Pakistan, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen.



So, now that Mr. Trump has been elected president, can you tell us if those are the six countries that will see a suspension of immigration?



GIULIANI: Well, I would say that those countries are certainly countries where we would have to be very careful.



Now, let's take Egypt, for example. Egypt, we could probably do some pretty good vetting. The Sisi government is a strong ally. It has a pretty good hold on the Muslim Brotherhood. I'm not saying perfect, but they have done a lot of work in reducing the power of the Muslim Brotherhood. They have a very, very mature and really strong army. You could do vetting in Egypt.



Yemen, a lot more volatile, a lot more difficult to do vetting. So, I think this is going to be a country-by-country decision. Pakistan, you can do pretty good vetting. So, a lot of this is going to depend on, you know, how cooperative is the country we're talking about? How many records can we get?



The reason the Syrian problem was so bad, the Syrian refugees, it's not just that you can't vet them, which actually Director Comey and I think about five members of the Obama administration have made clear, that you can't vet these people, these refugees from Syria.



[09:25:12]



The problem also is that Baghdadi has said he is going to put terrorist operatives in with the refugee population. He's told us he's going to do this.



TAPPER: Right.



GIULIANI: So, we would be foolish -- we would be foolish to allow these people to come into the United States.



We're sort of being warned that he's bringing more people into attack us. We already have 1,000 investigations of radical Islamic terrorists in the United States. We can't add another whole group to that.



TAPPER: I want to ask you. Russia's deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, was quoted as saying that the Russian government maintained contacts with members of Trump's -- quote -- ""immediate entourage"" during the presidential campaign.



What can you tell us about those contacts?



GIULIANI: I know of no such contacts with the Russian government.



I was pretty deeply involved in the campaign. I was with Donald Trump, you know, day and night for about 100 days actually at one period. So, if that's going on, it's going on somewhere where I didn't see it.



It is true that I think Donald Trump wants to engage Russia in areas where we can work together in a way that Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama failed to do. But, remember, he's going to do it from a different point of view.



You're forgetting his campaign promise of increasing dramatically the size of the military and doing away with the sequester. We're going to go up to 550,000 troops, where we're going down to 420,000.



TAPPER: Well, let me ask you a quick question about troops.



GIULIANI: We're going to go up to 350 ships.



TAPPER: Putin...



GIULIANI: We're going to go up to 350 troops (sic). Let me finish.



TAPPER: Yes.



GIULIANI: We're going to go up to 1,200 modern aircraft. And we're going to increase the size of the Marines from about 27 battalions to 36.



So, he's going to be facing, Putin, with a country that is not diminishing its military, but a country that is dramatically increasing it to Reagan-like levels, so that he can negotiate -- and he talked about this a lot during the campaign -- he's going to negotiate for peace, but with strength, not with a diminishing army.



TAPPER: A spokesman for Putin said that one of the first things that Trump can do as president is to convince NATO to pull back troops from near the Russian border.



Do you have any idea if any decision has been made along those lines?



GIULIANI: No. No decision like that has been made, thought about.



In fact, during the campaign, Donald Trump talked about forward positioning of some troops in NATO as kind of a bargaining chip with some of the NATO countries that are not putting in their fair share, their 2 percent. TAPPER: OK.



GIULIANI: And I think you're going see something more like that.



I think a President Trump would want to increase the impact of NATO, but make sure that these countries are participating. You know, when we were fighting in Iraq and we had some of these countries participating, their armies weren't fighting. They were watching us, the U.K., and Canada fight, and they were just observing.



Well, it can't work that way.



TAPPER: All right.



GIULIANI: They have got to be full participants. And we have to be full participants.



TAPPER: Mr. Mayor, thank you so much. And congratulations again.



GIULIANI: Thank you.



TAPPER: Donald Trump used the power of social media to help propel him into the White House. He instantly was able to fight back against critics, reporters, even members of his own party if they challenged him, which begged the question, what will President Trump' Twitter feed look like?



We now have his answer.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



TRUMP: I'm going to do very restrained, if I use it at all. I'm going to be very restrained.



I find it tremendous. It is a modern form of communication. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of. It's -- it's where it's at.



I do believe this. I really believe that the fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they're spending much more money than I spent. And I won.

AMANPOUR: Our correspondent is with American soldiers in the deadliest firefight against the Taliban in months.

Then in Libya, despite U.S. and NATO bombing runs meant to save them, rebels are in retreat from Gadhafi's forces. Is America in a battle it can't win? Three wars and billions of dollars later, we'll discuss all of this with the president's former national security adviser in his first interview since leaving the White House.

Also, who will pay for it all?

The jobs picture is getting brighter. But could rising prices, revolution, and a nuclear disaster kill the recovery? And as partisan bickering meets the bloated budget, will the government shut down later this week?

REP. MIKE PENCE R-IND.: I say, shut it down.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

AMANPOUR: Two top senators join us for a This Week debate.

ANNOUNCER: Live from the Newseum in Washington, This Week starts right now.

AMANPOUR: Welcome to the program. Right now, the Middle East is falling further into chaos, violence and uncertainty as the United States grapples with fresh challenges in two of its three wars. President Obama, who ran as the anti-war candidate, now finds himself struggling to defend new American military action overseas, while the rapidly changing situations in Libya, Afghanistan, and across the Middle East pose new threats to U.S. security and credibility.

I'll be talking to my colleagues Mike Boettcher and Nick Schifrin in Afghanistan, and Jeffrey Kaufman and Alex Marquardt on the front lines in Libya.

Let's turn first to Afghanistan, where a firefight along the Pakistan border brought one of the deadliest days for American troops in months, and where the battle for hearts and minds may have been virtually erased overnight at the hands of a fringe pastor in Florida.

After months of threatening to burn a copy of the Koran, Pastor Terry Jones and his handful of followers finally did just that. This deliberately provocative act received little media attention here in the United States, but it did spread like wildfire online. And within days, protests in Afghanistan turned deadly.

ABC's Mike Boettcher is embedded with the 101st Airborne Division. Mike was the lone reporter on that bloody six-day offensive along the border.

Mike, how bad was that?

MIKE BOETTCHER, ABC CORRESPONDENT: In 30 years of covering war, I have never seen such withering fire. And soldiers who have been deployed four or five times will tell you the same thing.

A high price was paid. Six U.S. soldiers were killed. Six were wounded. Two Afghan national army were killed. And seven Afghans were wounded in this battle, and the battle continues as we speak, right now.

This is a significant engagement because it marks a turning point or a change in strategy along the Pakistan border where bases have been closed in recent months, small combat outposts. The U.S. now says that they're taking a more mobile strategy, going to areas they haven't been before, and going after the Taliban. They're going to carry this through, through the spring and summer and expect to see very heavy fighting in the east part of the country in the coming year. Christiane?

AMANPOUR: Meantime, in cities across Afghanistan today, more scenes of rage and violence in response to that Florida pastor's decision to burn a Koran. The situation does present a grave new problem for the United States. And ABC's Nick Schifrin joins me now from Kabul.

Nick, today, General Petraeus had to come out and specifically condemn the burning of that Koran. How bad is it there?

NICK SCHIFRIN, ABC CORRESPONDENT: Well, we've seen three protests three days in a row now, massive protests, 8,000 miles away from that Koran-burning. Today thousands of Afghans in the streets of southern Afghanistan and eastern Afghanistan, they were burning U.S. flags and chanting ""death to President Obama.""

Now David Petraeus came out with that statement today, but there is one good piece of news. The Afghan police did not shoot into the crowds like they did yesterday. On Friday, they were supposed to be the first line of defense around a U.N. building where seven U.N. workers were killed. They were not able to keep those workers -- keep those protesters out of that U.N. building.

And U.S. officials are deeply concerned about that, because the place where that happened, Mazar-i-Sharif, is the first city that is supposed to transfer to Afghan control, to transfer to Afghan police control in three months.

And U.S. and U.N. officials are worried that this incident is a sign that the police aren't ready to take control -- Christiane. AMANPOUR: Nick, thank you. And obviously we'll keep monitoring that situation.

And now we turn to Libya. America's newest war is entering its third week of bombing, and still there is no sign that Colonel Gadhafi is stepping down. And now more bad news for the makeshift rebel forces. NATO warplanes seem to have mistakenly bombed one of their convoys. Another blow in a week where they've seen most of their gains against Gadhafi wiped out.

Just Monday, the rebels were within striking distance of capturing Gadhafi's home town of Sirt. And they had the capital Tripoli in their sites. But by week's end, they were beating a hasty retreat with Gadhafi forces once again in control of the long stretch of coastline.

Our reporters in Libya have been tracking all of this. Jeffrey Kaufman just arrived in Tripoli, and Alex Marquardt joins us from the rebel bastion of Benghazi. Let's start with Jeffrey.

Jeffrey, in Tripoli, any signs of the tension or that maybe Gadhafi is on his last few days?

JEFFREY KAUFMAN, ABC CORRESPONDENT: Well, actually, just moments ago we heard a NATO warplane flying above us. We didn't hear any bombs dropping. But, you know, it's actually remarkably normal here. You can see the traffic behind me on the highway.

As we came in, we saw a lot of military checkpoints, long lines for gasoline, a lot of shops closed. But the tension is not palpable at this point. The rebels are clearly on the retreat. Really, what we're seeing now in Libya is a divided country, almost two countries: the rebel-held east and the Gadhafi-held west.

And neither one seems to have the strength right now to unseat the other. Certainly the rebels aren't organized enough, manned enough, or skilled enough to come to Tripoli. And Gadhafi, it seems, the coalition will not let him go further east and retake those valuable oil fields in those areas.

So right now the word to describe this revolution, weeks into it, is stalemate -- Christiane.

AMANPOUR: Jeffrey, thank you. You mentioned stalemate and also divided country. And joining me now from the rebel-held city of Benghazi is ABC's Alex Marquardt.

Alex, how are these rebels dealing with being unable to really capitalize on all of the help the no-fly zone is giving them?

ALEX MARQUARDT, ABC CORRESPONDENT: Christiane, they're not able to capitalize because they are outmanned, they are outgunned, and they are not able to organize. They don't have the weapons to face Gadhafi's superior firepower. So they're forced to beat a retreat.

They don't have any sort of leadership. So when they retreat, they do so in a disorganized fashion, very quickly, no one showing them how to hold the line, how to retreat.

So we're seeing now glimmers of hope that they'll be able to organize. Experienced officers on the frontlines trying to corral these groups into units, keeping people back without any sort of training.

And for the first time on the frontlines on Friday we saw the general who is technically in charge of these forces, General Abdel Fattah Yunis, welcomed with a hero's welcome. So signs that there is some leadership coming to the frontlines that is so desperately needed by these rebels.

AMANPOUR: Alex, thank you so much.

Rarely has a president faced a foreign policy puzzle this complex. President Obama, of course, came into office pledging to repair America's relationship with the Muslim world. Now that relationship is tested like never before. Joining me to discuss the path forward, the president's former national security adviser, General Jim Jones. He's now a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center.

Thank you for joining us.

JONES: Thank you, Christiane. Good to be here.

AMANPOUR: Let's first talk about Afghanistan, since that seems to be a real crisis again at the moment. This pastor who burned the Koran, is unrepentant. Do you think despite the freedoms envisioned and expressed specifically in the American Constitution, he should not have burned that Koran?

JONES: Oh, I don't think he should have done that at all. I think it's extremely irresponsible, and look at what it has led to.

AMANPOUR: You also heard Mike Boettcher's report, a fierce firefight along the Pakistani border, one of the worst that the Americans had been involved in. Right now, do you think the United States forces can pull down significantly in July?

JONES: Well, I think that there can be and there will be some reduction of force in keeping with the agreement made at Portugal at the NATO summit in December to target 2014 as, in President Karzai's own words at the London Conference, ""This is when I want to be able to control my entire country.""

AMANPOUR: But can it be done responsibly, if you'd like?

JONES: Yes, I think so. I think it can be done responsibly. And we'll have to see what it looks like. A lot of it hinges on what happens on the other side of the border with our friends, the -- our neighbors the Pakistanis.

If Pakistan turns to what some of us think they should have done more effectively for a long period of time now, attacking and removing those safe havens that cause us so much difficulties, and if we can get some sort of coordination with their forces, then I think you can in fact...

(CROSSTALK)

AMANPOUR: You say if. You don't seem convinced that they're playing their part.

JONES: Well, I don't -- I'm not convinced. I think there was some good progress made in the Swat Valley and in North Waziristan a year or so ago. But it hasn't been sustained. There still seems to be that reluctance to engage comprehensively and buy into an overall plan that would, I think, really help Pakistan in the long term.

AMANPOUR: All right. General Jones, stay with us because up next we will talk about Libya. Will Libya become Obama's Iraq, as some are now suggesting? And it's a question you'll hear more and more in the coming days. I will ask General Jones if he sees an end in sight.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERT GATES, DEFENSE SECRETARY: There will be no American boots on the ground in Libya. Deposing the Gadhafi regime, as welcome as that eventuality would be, is not part of the military mission.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

AMANPOUR: Defense Secretary Robert Gates testifying on Capitol Hill Thursday. He is on the record saying that stopping the violence in Libya is not a vital national interest of the United States. But America is in the game now. And the big questions, for how long? And to what end? Let's bring back retired General Jim Jones, who was President Obama's first national security adviser.

Welcome back again. On Libya, Secretary Gates has said on this program and on several last week, that it was not in the vital interest of the United States. Do you agree?

JONES: I agree with that.

AMANPOUR: You agree that it's not in the vital interest?

JONES: I agree that it's not a vital interest in the sense that it affects the security -- the vital security of the nation. But we are part of an alliance. We are one of the global leaders, if not the global leader. And we have to do -- it is in the vital interest -- more in the vital interest of Europeans, when you consider the effects of massive immigration, the effects of terror, the effects of the oil market.

AMANPOUR: So the United States is now in it. You can call it what you want. But it's a third armed conflict.

JONES: We're a part of it. We are transitioning to a supporting part, only the United States could have gotten there as quickly as it did.

AMANPOUR: The United States is making a great fanfare about now giving over to NATO. But you were a former SACEUR, a former NATO commander. NATO, to all intents and purposes, is an American organization. It's run by an American commander. The chain of command is American. The biggest command and control and resources are American. This is still an American-led operation, right?

JONES: I'm not sure I completely agree with that. We have, you know, in the sorties that are being flown now, as I understand it, it's roughly 50-50. And it's going to go down to where the Americans are going to be supporting and reconnaissance, search and rescue, intelligence, refueling, things like that.

There are 40-some-odd ships off the coast, only 10 are American. There are 40 flag officers from different countries involved, only 10 of which are American. So it really is a -- I think it's encouraging to see allies stepping up at a level that we haven't seen before. I mean, it has been good.

AMANPOUR: What is the endgame? I mean, really, what is the endgame? We've seen two weeks of bombing. Gadhafi is where he is. Yes, there have been some high profile defections. The president has said Gadhafi has to go.

JONES: And this is the next piece that's the difficult piece. Because...

AMANPOUR: But what is -- how does one accomplish that?

JONES: The strategic question is, what do you do when Gadhafi goes? Because we don't know exactly who the opposition is, yet.

AMANPOUR: But before that, how do you get Gadhafi to go?

JONES: Well, that's the part that is being working on. And I think...

AMANPOUR: Do you know?

JONES: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know the answer to that. But I do know that that is the wish and the goal of this entire effort.

AMANPOUR: You mentioned, who are these rebels? It's a question everybody wants to know.

JONES: Opposition.

AMANPOUR: Opposition rebels...

JONES: You can call them whatever you want.

AMANPOUR: Whoever they are, freedom fighters. But the world has now taken their side. Who are they? Do you know? JONES: Well, I don't -- I personally do not know. And I know that there is tremendous effort going on in many capitals around the world to make sure that we do understand what that is.

AMANPOUR: When you see these rebels, as Alex Marquardt said and we've been reporting, unable to capitalize on the no-fly zone, what has to be done to help them? Should they be armed? Should they be trained?

JONES: Well, I think the first thing that has to be done is to find out who these -- who they are. And so if you start from the proposition that our reason for committing our forces, as Americans or as part of NATO, was basically to avoid a massacre of innocent civilians, which probably would have happened, and now we're there, and now we have to do -- now we have to take the rest -- follow the rest of the trail to identify these people, then decide, you know, whether that's meritorious or not in terms of training, organizing, equipping.

The United States has not done that yet.

AMANPOUR: Isn't it troubling that we don't know who they are and what their goals and aspirations are?

JONES: Well, it's a pop-up mission that came very quickly. It metastasized to the point where 700,000 people were going to be threatened. And, you know, I wish -- in all of these things, we always want it to be clear, we want nice end-state rules. But the fog of war doesn't sometimes allow for that.

And so now we are putting this together, I think, from what I can see, we're doing the things that have to be done before we decide -- before the coalition decides, the U.N. decides exactly what to do next.

AMANPOUR: Let's just quickly turn to Yemen, a major American ally. If Saleh falls, how bad is that for the fight against al Qaeda -- if the president of Yemen falls?

JONES: Well, I think that's -- I think Yemen is very worrisome. This is a -- Saleh has been very skillful over the years in being able to consolidate and maintain his power. The trends in Yemen are not good. And this could be a major problem. And where terror is concerned, this would be a safe haven that would be a very troubling turn of events for us.

AMANPOUR: So is the U.S. to try to keep Saleh in power or what?

JONES: Well, I don't know -- you know, there are certain things that we can do and that we can't do. When events reach a certain stage, they have a life of their own. And it would be nice to be able to think that we could do everything and make the world, you know, perfect the way we want it. But that's not the case.

So the trendlines in Yemen are not good. We've invested a lot of work in Yemen. But it is a disturbing trend for the future. And this is -- again, one of the things that I feel strongly about is that when you look at what's going on in this part of the world and you look at the potential, there is reason to be optimistic in some areas and there is reason to be very concerned in others.

But it's a tremendous tectonic shift in terms of the world as we know it, and this part of the world since -- for the last 80 years.

AMANPOUR: General Jones, thank you very much, indeed, for joining us.

And what do you think the U.S. should do next in Libya? Tweet me, @camanpour #libyanext.

Meantime, the costs of the new war are already piling up. More than half a billion dollars so far. All this as Congress and the White House remain at loggerheads over a federal budget, and a government shutdown is looming.

The deadline just five days off. Will lawmakers beat the clock? We'll hear from one of the Democrats' toughest negotiators, Senator Chuck Schumer, and the top Republican on the Budget Committee, Jeff Sessions. That's in a moment.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. JOHN BOEHNER, (R) OHIO: I have never believed that shutting the government down was the goal. And frankly, let's all be honest, if you shut the government down, it will end up costing more than you save because you interrupt contracts -- there are a lot of problems with the idea of shutting the government down. It is not the goal.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

AMANPOUR: House Speaker John Boehner, the man in the middle this weekend, caught between a rowdy freshman class of hardline conservatives and the more moderate congressional Republicans who want to deal.

Boehner, of course, wants a deal, too. But as senior political correspondent Jon Karl tells us, it's hard to broker compromise in a town where compromise itself has become a dirty word.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

CROWD: We want it back. We want it back.

JON KARL, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Compromise on spending cuts? Not if these folks have anything to say about it.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE; It's time to pick a fight.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because if we don't, we deserve to be thrown out of office.

REP MIKE PENCE, (R) INDIANA: Liberals in the Senate would rather play political games and shut down the government instead of making a small down payment on fiscal discipline and reform. I say, shut it down.

(CHEERS)

KARL: That was at a Tea Party rally on Capitol Hill where one organizer had this message for GOP leaders.

KATHY DIRR, TEA PARTY PATRIOT: I say to the Republican leadership, take off your lace panties. Stop being noodle-backs. KARL: The attitude runs deep among House Republicans, some of whom don't want to compromise on spending cuts, or issues like funding for Planned Parenthood. Democrats have already agreed to make more than $30 billion in cuts over the next six months, perhaps the largest cut Congress has ever made.

But Speaker of the House John Boehner's biggest challenge may be to convince his rank and file to accept victory.

BOEHNER: We control one half of one third of the government here in Washington. We can't impose our will on another body. We can't impose our will on the Senate. All we can do is fight for all of the spending cuts we can get an agreement to.

KARL: Democrats have their hot heads, too. One Obama administration official said the Republican bill, which cuts $5 billion from the agency for International Development would kill kids. That's right. Kill kids.

RAJIV SHAH, USAID ADMINISTRATOR: We estimate, and I believe these are conservative. That HR 1 would lead to 70,000 kids dying.

KARL: For weeks, Democrats have been accusing Republicans of putting the country at risk of a government shutdown. Enter Howard Dean.

HOWARD DEAN, FRM. DNC CHAIRMAN: Yeah!

KARL: Former Democratic Party chairman who told a forum this week that it is Democrats who should quietly rooting for a shutdown so they can blame it all on Republicans.

DEAN: From a partisan point of view, I think it would be the best thing in the world to have a shutdown.

KARL: And even the Democratic leaders trying to negotiate the deal seem to have one word describe their Republican colleagues.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Extreme level far to the right.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE; Extreme Tea Party.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Extreme territory beyond what was reasonable.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Small, extreme minority.

KARL: Compromise with extremists out to kill kids? They have less than a week to make it happen.

For This Week I'm Jonathan Karl.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

AMANPOUR: And joining me now, the Senate's third ranking Democrat, who you just saw there, Chuck Schumer, who joins us from his home state of New York, at our bureau there this morning. And with me here in the Newseum, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the budget committee.

Senators thank you very much for joining me.

Well, you saw Jon Karl's piece. And there's, you know, a lot of hijinks in that piece.

Let's get to the bottom of what's going on, Senator Sessions, has any progress been made this weekend amongst negotiators?

SESSIONS: I don't know that it has.

AMANPOUR: Is that a no?

SESSIONS: Well, I don't know that it has.

Mr. Boehner, the speaker, has indicated that he has not reached an agreement. So has Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader. So I think that negotiations continue and they need to continue.

But what this is -- Christiane, we really need to understand this is more than a Republican-Democratic squabble. This is -- the fundamental question is, are we headed to a financial crisis if we don't get off the fiscal course we're on? We have had witness after witness say that is so, Erskine Bowles said that President Obama's choice to head the debt commission, we're facing the most predictable debt crisis in American history. It could happen within two years.

We have got to take action now.

AMANPOUR: And we'll get to that.

Senator Schumer, from your perspective, has any progress been made? Will there be a shutdown in five days?

SCHUMER: Yes. No I don't -- excuse me. I don't think there will be a shutdown, Christiane. In fact, I'm quite optimistic. I think progress is being made. They're working off a number, $33 billion in cuts. That's very reasonable. It's right in between what Democrats have proposed and Republicans have proposed right in the middle. And after all, that was the number proposed originally by the House Republican leaders, Ryan and Rogers, the head of the appropriations committee.

So they're working off that number. That's good. Now we have to figure out what goes into that number. And that's where the discussions are headed.

Let me just say a word about that. We have two goals here. Jeff is right, we have to deal with the deficit very seriously. But we also have to deal with the economy and job growth. And we don't want to snuff that out. And particularly when we're beginning to see jobs grow.

If you just cut from domestic discretionary, you'll have to cut things like helping students go to college, you'll have to cut scientific research, including cancer research. These things have created millions of jobs through the years.

And so the good news is this: There's another place we can look to cut not just on domestic discretionary. It's called mandatory spending. It requires you to do something for somebody, but the way of doing it is not required. We can find cuts in places like agriculture and justice and banking. These are now being called CHIMPS...

AMANPOUR: CHIMPS?

SCHUMER: CHIMPS, yes, changes in mandatory program spending.

And we've offered about $10 billion of those to our Republican colleagues. They're not adverse to them, because HR 1 had some of those in. And I believe that's how we can come to an agreement that both keeps job growth and cuts the deficit at about the $33 billion level. And I believe that's where we'll end up.

AMANPOUR: You've raised a number of issues there. Let me first quickly ask Senator Sessions, do you -- we're talking about the job numbers, do you think that's -- that's good news, obviously. The job numbers have increased. The unemployment number has come down, lowest in two years.

SESSIONS: Well, it's really high.

AMANPOUR: It is, but it's come down. That's good.

SESSIONS: Not much.

This was a good month. This was a good month of a little over 200,000. We need to average 250,000 jobs a month. In the last three months we have only averaged 124,000 new jobs. We are well below where we need to be.

One of the reasons, as the testimony of Secretary Geithner, President Obama's Secretary of Treasury, testified that the debt is pulling down our growth and creates a threat of a crisis that could put us back into recession. We have got to make changes now.

AMANPOUR: Can you live with the short-term method here. Can you live with the $33 billion in cuts?

SESSIONS: I really believe we should do 61 total as the House proposed over ten years. That would be a savings of $860 billion.

We have to borrow this money. The House has sent a bill over that reduces what is before us, discretionary spending, CR, is the only thing before us. They proposed 61. The Democrats started at 4 or 5. They've how to been pushed up to halfway. I think we should go all the way.

But we'll have to let our leaders work on this and see, hopefully, an agreement that goes as far as possible.

AMANPOUR: As this haggling continues, I'm going to ask you, Senator Sessions. Speaker Boehner this week basically said, and I think it's sarcasm, thank you guys for painting me into a box that's just where I want to be, talking about the conservative -- the Tea Partiers. Have they held the Republican leadership sort of hostage in these negotiations.

SESSIONS: Christiane, that's the Democratic spin. That's the way...

AMANPOUR: But this is what Speaker Boehner said.

SESSIONS: I know that. But I'm telling you what the real deal is. This week, the House -- Republican House will submit a mature, serious budget for long-term reform of spending in America that will avoid a debt crisis this country is facing in two years, according to Mr. Erskine Bowles.

The Democrats have no plan except the president's plan which makes the debt worse than the current trajectory we're on. It raises taxes. It increases spending even more. It doubles the debt. We'll take interest from $200 billion last year in one year to $900 billion in 10 years, crowding out all kind of social programs and beneficial programs that Senator Schumer has talked about.

AMANPOUR: Right. Senator Schumer...

SCHUMER: Well, let me say this, Christiane. Yes, I have a lot of sympathy for Speaker Boehner because he does want to come to an agreement. He knows how devastating a shutdown would be. That's his words, not ours. Although we all agree on that.

The one group that's standing in the way here is the tea party. Now they have said that a shutdown is a good thing. You saw it on that tape. Some of their leaders have said it over and over again. Sarah Palin, Mike Pence, Michelle Bachmann. They say it's our way or no way.

Well, that's not how the American government works. And I would say this though, here's the good news. The American people are seeing the tea party for what it is, extreme. And their popularity is declining.

They now have only 33 percent of people in support of them, and 47 percent people against them. And when they lose clout, it makes an agreement much more likely. It's another reason I'm optimistic.

AMANPOUR: All right. Let me just ask you this before we turn to you, Senator Sessions. Today -- or rather, this week, you sort of stepped in it, sort of recording-wise. You were caught briefing your fellow senators on how to address this issue, didn't know apparently the reporters were still on the conference call. Let's just play that, because it plays right into the spin and the language about what is going on right now.

(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)

SCHUMER: I always use the word ""extreme."" That's what the caucus instructed me to do the other week. Extreme cuts and all these riders. And Boehner is in a box. But if he supports the tea party, there's going to inevitably be a shutdown.

(END AUDIO CLIP)

SCHUMER: Now, you know, Christiane, I have no problem with reporters hearing that. I said it a few hours before on the floor of the Senate. I've said on it this show. The tea party is the group standing in the way. They are extreme.

Any group that says you don't cut oil subsidies to companies making billions and billions of dollars, subsidies that were passed when the price of oil was $17 to encourage production, and now the price is over $100, and at the same time, says, cut student aid to help qualified students go to college, yes, I believe they're extreme. And I have no problem with that...

(CROSSTALK)

AMANPOUR: OK, Senator Sessions, extreme and holding the party hostage.

SESSIONS: It's absolutely false. Millions of Americans participated in the tea parties. Tens of millions of Americans support and believe what they're saying. And they are right fundamentally. Maybe they don't understand all the realities of Washington politics.

AMANPOUR: But are they right for being...

SESSIONS: But fundamentally they know this country is on a path to fiscal disaster. As Erskine Bowles said, as Secretary Geithner has said, as Alan Greenspan has said, we're heading -- and this Democratic leadership proposes nothing.

AMANPOUR: Do you believe...

SESSIONS: But to attack the people who are trying to get this country on the right course.

AMANPOUR: Do you believe there will be a shutdown?

SESSIONS: I hope not.

AMANPOUR: But do you think there will be?

SESSIONS: I doubt it. I doubt there will be a shutdown.

AMANPOUR: All right. Well, both of you agree on that. And, of course, we do have to talk at another time about these huge mega- issues, which really right now is tinkering around the edges, isn't it? The big, big entitlement programs.

SESSIONS: We're talking about trillions of dollars.

AMANPOUR: Precisely. And we'll have you back... SESSIONS: And the president has no plan whatsoever to deal with it.

AMANPOUR: There seems to be no plan in general.

SCHUMER: That's not true at all.

AMANPOUR: And we'll discuss that the next time.

SCHUMER: That's not true at all.

AMANPOUR: Thank you very much, indeed, for being on this program.

And tell us your thoughts on the war on Capitol Hill. Tweet me @camanpour #budgetbattle.

And up next, new job numbers are moving in the right direction, as we have heard, but could a government shutdown deal a serious blow to the recovery? We'll get answers from our roundtable.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

AMANPOUR: A Florida pastor's reckless stunt sends shock waves across Afghanistan, bringing mayhem and death. But today, Terry Jones is unrepentant. How does the White House contain the damage caused by a preacher gone rogue? Our ""Roundtable"" tackles that one. Stay tuned.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

OBAMA: Today, we learned that we added 230,000 private sector jobs last month. And that's good news. That means more packages, right?

(END VIDEO CLIP)

AMANPOUR: The president at a UPS facility on Friday. And yes, the jobs picture is looking up. Unemployment is the lowest it has been since March of 2009, just after President Obama took office.

politifact8085,"CNN's Don Lemon: Bill O'Reilly's Criticism Of Black Community ""Doesn't Go Far Enough""DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: I want to talk to you because we're going to take a break from the headlines to talk about something I've had on my mind for quite some time now. So much so that I felt compelled to bring back our segment where we hold politicians, leaders, and pundits accountable for what comes out of their mouths. It's time now, again, for No Talking Points.



The Trayvon Martin murder case got just about everybody talking about race, and not just specifically how it related to the case. It got some, many on the political right, wondering why the so-called liberal media wasn't talking about other problems in the black community.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



JUDY MILLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Let's talk about race. Let's talk about black-on-black violence.



DAVID WEBB, HOST ""THE DAVID WEBB SHOW"": The outrage that I have is in the lack of really the national attention to what is an epidemic of crime in the black community committed largely by blacks.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



LEMON: Why aren't we talking about it? Good question. Actually, that's not a good question. We talked about it many times on this show and on CNN. It's actually a good deflection as I've said a number of times to a number of guests here on CNN and also on the radio.



(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)



LEMON: David, do not that false equivalent. That is not --



UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not trying to equivocate --



LEMON: But, listen, crime happens all the time and because a crime happens, it does not mean that you should shift the focus from what happened here. Let's stick to this particular point so continue and let's talk about this case.



UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you.



UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On this case --



(END VIDEOTAPE) LEMON: So, that's the reason I didn't want to discuss at length crime in the African-American community or how to fix other ills that seem to be plaguing the community in general. But now that the jury has reached one that everyone must accept it's time now for some tough love on the subject.



Someone on another network got the chance to go first because I couldn't go during the week. I'm only here on the weekend, so listen to this --



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



BILL O'REILLY, FOX NEWS HOST: The reason there is so much violence and chaos in the black precincts is the disintegration of the African- American family.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



LEMON: He's got a point. In fact, he's got more than a point. Bill?



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



O'REILLY: Raised without much structure, young black men often reject education and gravitate towards the street culture, drugs, hustling, gangs. Nobody forces them to do that, again, it is a personal decision.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



LEMON: He is right about that, too. But in my estimation, he doesn't go far enough. Because black people, if you really want to fix the problem, here's just five things that you should think about doing. Here's number five, and if this doesn't apply to you, if you're not doing this, then it doesn't apply to you, I'm not talking to you.



Here's number five. Pull up your pants. Some people, a lot of them black, gave me flak for saying that recently on ""The Wendy Williams Show.""



(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)



LEMON: If you're sagging, I mean -- I think it's your self-esteem that is sagging and who you are as a person it's sagging. Young people need to be taught respect and there are rules.



(END VIDEOTAPE)



LEMON: Sagging pants, whether Justin Bieber or No-name Derek around the way, walking around with your ass and your underwear showing is not OK. In fact, it comes from prison when they take away belts from the prisoners so that they can't make a weapon. And then it evolved into which role a prisoner would have during male-on-male prison sex. The one with the really low pants is the submissive one. You get my point?



Number four now is the n-word. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



JAY-Z, RAPPER: For our generation what we did was we took the word and we took the power out of that word.



CHRIS ROCK, COMEDIAN/ACTOR: We took this word, and we made it into poetry.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



LEMON: I understand poetic license, but consider this: I hosted a special on the n-word, suggesting that black people stop using it and that entertainers stop deluding yourselves or themselves and others that you're somehow taking the word back.



(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)



LEMON: By promoting the use of that word when it's not germane to the conversation, have you ever considered that you may be just perpetuating the stereotype the master intended acting like a nigger?



(END VIDEOTAPE)



LEMON: A lot of African-Americans took offense to that, too. I wonder if I gave the right advice, I really did. But confirmation came the very next day on my way home when I exited the subway in 125th Street in Harlem. This little kid in a school uniform no older than seven years old, he was crying his eyes out as he walked down the sidewalk with his mother.



I'm going to be honest here, she turned to me, and she said ""I'm sick of you. You act like an old ass man, stop all that crying, nigger."" Is that taking the word back? Think about that.



Now number three. Respect where you live. Start small by not dropping trash, littering in your own communities. I've lived in several predominantly white neighborhoods in my life, I rarely, if ever, witnessed people littering. I live in Harlem now, it's an historically black neighborhood, every single day I see adults and children dropping their trash on the ground when a garbage can is just feet away. Just being honest here.



Number two, finish school. You want to break the cycle of poverty? Stop telling kids they're acting white because they go to school or they speak proper English. A high school dropout makes on average $19,000 a year, a high school graduate makes $28,000 a year, a college graduate makes $51,000 a year. Over the course of a career, a college grad will make nearly $1 million more than a high school graduate. That's a lot of money.



And number one, and probably the most important, just because you can have a baby, it doesn't mean you should. Especially without planning for one or getting married first. More than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock. That means absent fathers. And the studies show that lack of a male role model is an express train right to prison and the cycle continues. So, please, black folks, as I said if this doesn't apply to you, I'm not talking to you. Pay attention to and think about what has been presented in recent history as acceptable behavior. Pay close attention to the hip-hop and rap culture that many of you embrace. A culture that glorifies everything I just mentioned, thug and reprehensible behavior, a culture that is making a lot of people rich, just not you. And it's not going to. That said, though, the political right is not off the hook.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



KRISTEN POWERS, DAILY BEAST COLUMNIST: If conservatives are so concerned about black-on-black crime, it's a little concerning the only time I hear them talking about it is when they want to stick it to the black community.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



LEMON: And that's today's ""No Talking Points.""",0
politifact4306,"Opinion | Stop Coddling the Super-RichSince 1992, the I.R.S. has compiled data from the returns of the 400 Americans reporting the largest income. In 1992, the top 400 had aggregate taxable income of $16.9 billion and paid federal taxes of 29.2 percent on that sum. In 2008, the aggregate income of the highest 400 had soared to $90.9 billion — a staggering $227.4 million on average — but the rate paid had fallen to 21.5 percent.

The taxes I refer to here include only federal income tax, but you can be sure that any payroll tax for the 400 was inconsequential compared to income. In fact, 88 of the 400 in 2008 reported no wages at all, though every one of them reported capital gains. Some of my brethren may shun work but they all like to invest. (I can relate to that.)

I know well many of the mega-rich and, by and large, they are very decent people. They love America and appreciate the opportunity this country has given them. Many have joined the Giving Pledge, promising to give most of their wealth to philanthropy. Most wouldn’t mind being told to pay more in taxes as well, particularly when so many of their fellow citizens are truly suffering.

Twelve members of Congress will soon take on the crucial job of rearranging our country’s finances. They’ve been instructed to devise a plan that reduces the 10-year deficit by at least $1.5 trillion. It’s vital, however, that they achieve far more than that. Americans are rapidly losing faith in the ability of Congress to deal with our country’s fiscal problems. Only action that is immediate, real and very substantial will prevent that doubt from morphing into hopelessness. That feeling can create its own reality.

Job one for the 12 is to pare down some future promises that even a rich America can’t fulfill. Big money must be saved here. The 12 should then turn to the issue of revenues. I would leave rates for 99.7 percent of taxpayers unchanged and continue the current 2-percentage-point reduction in the employee contribution to the payroll tax. This cut helps the poor and the middle class, who need every break they can get.

But for those making more than $1 million — there were 236,883 such households in 2009 — I would raise rates immediately on taxable income in excess of $1 million, including, of course, dividends and capital gains. And for those who make $10 million or more — there were 8,274 in 2009 — I would suggest an additional increase in rate.

My friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress. It’s time for our government to get serious about shared sacrifice.",0

politifact1783,"'This Week' Transcript: Holder and GiulianiMay 9, 2010  -- TAPPER: Good morning, and a happy Mother's Day to all the moms watching. We'll begin with a Sunday first, Attorney General Eric Holder. Welcome to ""This Week.""

HOLDER: It's good to be here.

TAPPER: Well, let's start with the latest on the investigation into the failed Times Square bomber, Faisal Shahzad. What's the latest?

HOLDER: Well, we've now developed evidence that shows that the Pakistani Taliban was behind the attack. We know that they helped facilitate it. We know that they probably helped finance it and that he was working at their direction.

TAPPER: Is there any evidence that there's a cell that Shahzad was working with in the United States? Or was it just him operating from directions from Pakistan?

HOLDER: All I can really say is that the investigation is ongoing and we are examining overseas connections that he might have, as well as any people he might have worked with here in the United States. But the investigation's ongoing in both those spheres.

TAPPER: In the last few days, U.S. officials have met with Pakistani officials, and the message, as conveyed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on ""60 Minutes"" is this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

CLINTON: We want more. We expect more. We've made it very clear that if, heaven forbid, an attack like this that we can trace back to Pakistan were to have been successful, there would be very severe consequences.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

TAPPER: What would those consequences be? And what more do you need the Pakistanis to be doing, the Pakistani government, beyond increased military action in North Waziristan, where the Pakistani Taliban is primarily located?

HOLDER: Well, in connection with the Shahzad investigation, they had been, I think, extremely aggressive, they've been cooperative with us, and I think we have been satisfied with the work that they have done. We want to make sure that kind of cooperation continues. To the extent that it does not, we will, as Secretary Clinton indicated, take the appropriate steps. But as of now, with regard to Shahzad, I think we're satisfied with the level of cooperation we've received.

TAPPER: Did the Pakistani government know about Shahzad before this happened? And did they tell the U.S. government at all anything about that?

HOLDER: We don't have any indication that the Pakistani government was aware of his plans or the attack that was planned by the Pakistani Taliban. We don't have any indication of that.

TAPPER: OK, Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud of the Pakistani -- Pakistani Taliban appeared in a video last month saying the time is very near when a Fedayeen, or soldiers, will attack the American states in the major cities. At the time that he issued that warning, U.S. policymakers didn't think the Pakistani Taliban had the ability to reach into the United States. They were, obviously, wrong?

HOLDER: Well, I'm not sure that we didn't think they had that ability. We didn't think that necessarily was their aim. We certainly have seen with the Shahzad incident that they have not only the aim, but the capability of doing that. And that's why they have taken on, I think, a new significance in our anti-terror fight.

TAPPER: Shahzad was on a Treasury Department watch list since the late 1990s for bringing large sums of cash into this country. He was taken off that watch list. Did the U.S. government drop the ball?

HOLDER: No, I don't think so. I think we have done a good job in monitoring those people who we need to identify as potential threats to the, you know, government, and I think one has to understand that in connection with the -- the resolution of this plot, American law enforcement I think was very successful.

TAPPER: More than 200,000 people from the U.S. traveled to Pakistan last year. How on Earth do you keep track of which ones intend to do us harm?

HOLDER: It is a difficult job. We have to try to use the various intelligence sources that we have, try to look for telltale signs for who we should be concerned about.

The vast majority of people who go to Pakistan and come from Pakistan to the United States are well intentioned. They have relatives. They have cultural ties to both countries. So we have to really try to focus and make sure that our attention is directed at those people who would do our nation harm.

TAPPER: There have been reports that others arrested this year in terrorist plots in the United States had traveled to Pakistan. Are there any ties with Shahzad?

HOLDER: Well, the investigation's ongoing. And we're looking at a variety of things to try to make sure that we hold everybody accountable who was responsible for this attempted attack. I think the investigation is proceeding at a good pace. We have developed, I think, a good amount of information in a relatively short period of time, but we will be continuing to work on it.

TAPPER: There was a time when the FBI and law enforcement lost track of Shahzad after the attempted incident, before he got on the plane. What happened?

HOLDER: Well, we lost contact with him for just a bit of time, but I think what people have to understand is that we had a layered approach so that at the end of the day I think we were always confident that he would be picked up, and the question was only where he would be picked up and when he would be picked up.

A surveillance was conducted, but we wanted to have him at a fairly good distance so that we could observe him and see if he would make contact with other people who were connected to the plot. Contact was lost for a relatively short period of time.

TAPPER: How long? An hour?

HOLDER: Oh, I don't know, about an hour, so maybe something along those lines. But what was key and what ultimately proved to be successful was this layered approach. He was caught before he was able to leave the country.

TAPPER: But he almost got out, right? I mean, we got lucky in a few ways. First of all, let's be honest: The reason that we avoided a horrible incident is because he was apparently an incompetent bomb- maker, right?

HOLDER: Well, there certainly was a bit of that, but I think also one has to look at the overall operation. He was stopped before he was able to leave the country because of a notification that the FBI made to put him on the no-fly list. We also had vigilant citizens who looked at that vehicle that he left and saw the smoke coming out and notified the appropriate authorities.

This was, in some ways, I think, a good example of what an aroused American populace, coupled with a vigilant law enforcement community, can actually do.

TAPPER: Critics say that he should not have been -- some critics say he should not have been his Miranda rights, the right to remain silent, et cetera. Now, I know that the public safety exception was invoked, so before he was read his rights, he was interrogated. But does the current Miranda system, which was created before I was born and was updated, this public safety exception, in 1984 -- so none of the crafters were really aware of this plot, this threat that we face today.

Does it give you the flexibility you need?

HOLDER: Well, that's one of the things that we're looking at. I think we have to first say that the system that we have in place has proven to be effective. We have used our law enforcement authorities that we have as they now exist very effectively. People have been given Miranda warnings. People have continued to talk, as was the case here, as was the case with Abdulmutallab in Detroit.

But I think we also want to look at make determinations as to whether or not we have the necessary flexibility, whether we have a system that can deal with the situation that agents now confront. The public safety exception comes from a case called Quarles that dealt with a -- the robbery of a -- of a supermarket.

We're now dealing with international terrorism. And if we are going to have a system that is capable of dealing in a public safety context with this new threat, I think we have to give serious consideration to at least modifying that public safety exception. And that's one of the things that I think we're going to be reaching out to Congress to do, to come up with a proposal that is both constitutional, but that is also relevant to our time and the threat that we now face.

TAPPER: What kind of modification are you talking about, more time for the -- for investigation before the Miranda rights are read or what?

HOLDER: Well, I think a number of possibilities, and those are the kinds of things that we'll be discussing with Congress, to make sure that we are as effective as we can be, that agents are clear in what it is that they can do and interacting with people in this context, so we're going to be working with Congress so that we come up with something that, as I said, gives the necessary clarity, is flexible, but is also constitutional, is also constitutional.

TAPPER: Senator Joe Lieberman and some others introduced legislation this past week which would give the State Department the right to strip the U.S. citizenship from anyone who is designated a foreign terrorist agent. I understand the administration does not support this and thinks that there are constitutional issues, but there's a point that Senator Lieberman made about the fact that President Obama currently has the authority -- at least according to Lieberman, who's the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee -- to order the assassination of a U.S. citizen, the cleric Awlaki, and -- well, this is what Senator Lieberman had to say.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

LIEBERMAN: If the president can authorize the killing of a United States citizen because he is fighting for a foreign terrorist organization, we can also have a law that allows the U.S. government to revoke Awlaki's citizenship and that of other American citizens who have cast their lot with terrorist organizations.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

TAPPER: Isn't there a strange double-standard here? The administration gets all offended about revoking, you know, terrorist suspects' citizenship, but feels no compunction at all about ordering their assassination?

HOLDER: Well, I'm not going to assume that what has been said there about ordering anybody's assassination is necessarily true. But with regard to the bill that Senator Lieberman is potentially talking about, that's not something I had a chance to really review. There are potential constitutional issues with it, as I've seen some critics discuss. I've not had a chance, as I said, to review it in any great detail, but I think what people have to understand is that the system we presently have in place takes terrorists and can put them in jail for extended periods of time. We can put people in jail fro the rest of their lives. We can even execute people under the law as it presently exists, and one has to wonder whether we need to go further than that.

TAPPER: I want to turn to a couple of other topics. You and the White House have been proud of the improved review process for the release or transfer of detainees from Guantanamo, and in fact, writing of those detainees who had been released and who have returned to terrorism, White House counterterrorism czar John Brennan wrote in February, quote, ""I want to underscore the fact that all these cases relate to detainees released during the previous administration and under the prior detainee review process,"" but in fact there are reports that a detainee released by the Obama administration in December into Afghanistan, Abdul Hafeez (ph), has rejoined the Taliban. Did this review process fail?

HOLDER: I've seen this story. I've not seen the intelligence necessarily that confirms that. I don't think -- one has to understand that the process that we've put in place, of the 240 prisoners who were in Guantanamo when we took office, was exhaustible. It involved the law enforcement community, it involved the intelligence community. We took into account all of the information we had on each one of those people, did an analysis of each of them, and made a determination as to who potentially was a threat. Only put people in countries where we thought structures could be in place, put in place so that they would not be a threat--

TAPPER: What structure could possibly exist in Afghanistan?

HOLDER: Well, that's one of the reason why, for instance, with regard to Yemen, the president has made a determination that we're going to suspend the repatriation of people to Yemen to make sure that we don't take anybody out of Guantanamo and put them in a country where they could pose a threat to the United States or to American military forces.

TAPPER: But you're not going to confirm that Abdul Hafeez has rejoined the fight against the United States.

HOLDER: I am not in a position to confirm that. As I said, I've not seen any intelligence that corroborates that.

TAPPER: OK. Last fall, you announced that the trial of the century against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and other 9/11 plotters would take place in New York City, but it seems to me that that's walked back by the White House. Here is what you had to say about the president's response to your announcement of the trial last fall to PBS.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HOLDER: He has a personal belief that the president is supposed to be hands off with his Justice Department, and those things that are the province of the attorney general, all he needs to be is informed.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

TAPPER: This doesn't seem to be the case any longer. Are you disappointed that the White House seems to be politicizing the decisions you make about the trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed?

HOLDER: I don't think the decision has been politicized at all. This is a national security matter, and I think it's appropriate for the president to be involved in that decision. We are working to see exactly where the trial will be held. Nothing is really off the table at this point. We are trying to come up with a place where these people can be brought to justice as quickly as we can, taking into consideration a variety of things that we have to consider. And I think in that regard, the involvement of the president, given the fact that it is a national security matter, as opposed to something else the Justice Department might be doing, his involvement I think is appropriate.

TAPPER: You've said we're a nation of cowards because we don't talk freely and openly about race. So in that spirit, let me give it a shot. Do you think the Arizona immigration law is racist?

HOLDER: Well, I don't think it's necessarily a good idea. I mean, I think we have to understand that the immigration problem that we have, illegal immigration problem that we have, is a national one, and a state-by-state solution to it is not the way in which we ought to go.

TAPPER: But your issue with it is not that it's state-by-state. Your issue with it is that there are concerns that there might be racial profiling that takes place, right?

HOLDER: That is certainly one of the concerns that you have, that you'll end up in a situation where people are racially profiled, and that could lead to a wedge drawn between certain communities and law enforcement, which leads to the problem of people in those communities not willing to interact with people in law enforcement, not willing to share information, not willing to be witnesses where law enforcement needs them. I think you have to think about the collateral consequences of such a law, understanding the frustration that people feel in Arizona. IT's one of the reasons why I think we have to have a national solution to this immigration problem.

TAPPER: Do you think it's racist?

HOLDER: I don't think it's racist in its motivation. But I think the concern I have is how it will be perceived and how it perhaps could be enacted, how it could be carried out. I think we could potentially get on a slippery slope where people will be picked on because of how they look as opposed to what they have done, and that is I think something that we have to try to avoid at all costs.

TAPPER: The oil company BP has a spotty record when it comes to cutting corners and, in some cases, worker safety. Are you looking into the oil spill in the gulf, possible criminal charges, and ways to make sure that these companies -- not just BP, but Halliburton and the others -- are held accountable?

HOLDER: Well, our primary concern at this point is to try to make sure that we keep that oil offshore, that we disperse it, that we scoop it up, that we burn it, that we do all those kinds of things so that it can't get to shore and do damage to our wetlands, damage businesses that are on the coast.

I've sent down representatives from the Justice Department to examine what our options are with regard to the activities that occurred there and whether or not there has been misfeasance, malfeasance on the part of BP or Oceana (ph).

So we're looking at that situation. But as I said, our primary focus at this point -- through our Department of Homeland Security, the Interior Department -- is really try to deal with the spill.

TAPPER: All right. That's all the time we have. Attorney General Eric Holder, thank you so much for coming by.

HOLDER: Well, thanks for having me. I appreciate it.

TAPPER: And joining me now from New York, former mayor and Republican presidential candidate, Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Mayor, thanks so much for joining us.

GIULIANI: Well, thank you, Jake.

TAPPER: Now, you're a former U.S. attorney. If you had been in charge of this investigation, what -- into Faisal Shahzad, what would you do differently, if anything?

GIULIANI: Well, I would not have given him Miranda warnings after just a couple of hours of questioning. I would have instead declared him an enemy combatant, asked the president to do that, and at the same time, that would have given us the opportunity to question him for a much longer period of time. Whether it works in the case of Shahzad or it doesn't, the reality is, the better policy is to give the intelligence agents who are going to question him the maximum amount of time to question him, to check out the credibility of what he's saying.

I mean, I don't know yet what the truth is here. We shouldn't. I mean, I think too much has been leaked about this, and the administration has talked too much about it, because the more you talk about it, the more you warn people in the Taliban to go hide somewhere.

When I was a prosecutor and associate attorney general, the last thing in the world I wanted to do is to have the other side figure out, you know, the information we had before we had a chance to act on it. So the reality is, just to figure -- just to get these guys to tell the truth and then to corroborate how much they're saying and for them to remember, it's going to take three, four, five days of questioning.

To cut it off after 30 or 40 minutes like they did in Detroit on Christmas Day or to cut it off after two or three hours doesn't make much sense. And if they think they need to change the law, well, my goodness, have some urgency about it and go do it. Don't just think about it.

TAPPER: So you support what Attorney General Holder had to say about going to Congress and trying to get an updated Miranda warning?

GIULIANI: I do. I do. I support it, but I really at this point am frustrated by the lack of urgency that is shown about these terrorism matters. I mean, we've had three now where we've seen, you know, big breakdowns: Fort Hood, Christmas Day, and now -- and now this one.

It's about time that we stopped thinking about it and we stopped studying it. I don't know how often the attorney general said he was studying things. How about we stop studying and we start doing things, like we change Miranda, like we fix what appears to be a policy of political correctness in which we missed every signal that related to Major Hasan and promoted him in the military?

And here we missed some very big signals that Shahzad was giving us, going back to Pakistan, remaining there for five or six months, bringing in -- I've forgotten exactly how much cash he brought in from Pakistan, but I think it was something like $60,000...

(CROSSTALK)

TAPPER: It was something like -- I think it was $80,000...

GIULIANI: Eighty thousand dollars in cash.

TAPPER: ... but it was several -- several years ago, yes.

GIULIANI: Yes, but that doesn't trigger an alarm, even several years ago?

(CROSSTALK)

TAPPER: ... triggered an alarm and he was...

GIULIANI: ... fix these things now instead of talking about them.

TAPPER: Apparently, it did trigger an alarm. He was put on a Treasury watch list, but I'm not sure what more could have been done after that.

GIULIANI: Well, don't you see a pattern here, Jake? And I'm not -- I'm just not talking about the Obama administration. I'm talking about our entire apparatus that has to be fixed. We missed the signals with -- with the -- the -- the bomber in -- in -- in Detroit. We missed the signals with Major Hasan. We missed the signals here.

Maybe we've got to say to ourselves, let's go back and fix all this, rather than study it, to see what we're going to do. We've been at this long enough now to stop studying and start doing things.

TAPPER: I want to talk about the fact that you think that Shahzad should be tried as an enemy combatant. Can you point to any time when a U.S. citizen was interrogated as an enemy combatant as opposed to in the criminal system where the result, the interrogation was more successful than apparently this interrogation is going? I mean, Attorney General Holder and other law enforcement officials say...

GIULIANI: Oh, sure.

TAPPER: ... this is going very well.

GIULIANI: Well, yes, that's OK. I like that. I'm glad it's going very well. And I've, you know, administered Miranda warnings probably 1,000 times, and sometimes they work and the person -- they worked to have the person keep -- keep talking. Sometimes the person stops talking. It depends on the reaction of the person. It's the matter of policy that concerns me.

This is not a smart thing to do. It doesn't make sense to interrupt a terrorist in the middle of his confessing and talking to you. I think even Attorney General Holder realizes that, which is why he wants to go to Congress and seem to get more time for that.

All I'm saying is, OK, do it. What they did in Detroit, in giving Major -- rather...

TAPPER: Abdulmutallab.

GIULIANI: ... Abdulmutabalab (sic) a -- a -- right, giving him a warning after -- after 30 minutes makes no sense. It makes no sense to do that. So, sure, it may work sometimes; it may not work other times. It's not the best policy to follow.

And so far, two in a row, we've gotten lucky. So let's not rely on luck. Let's rely on solid policy.

TAPPER: My understanding, during the Abdulmutallab incident, is that -- is that actually after about 50 minutes they had to take him to get medical care, and that's why he stopped talking then, because he actually -- his life was in danger. But be that as it may, I fear the point you're making.

I want to ask you a question about, in the trial of Richard Reid in 2003, Judge William Young said to Richard Reid in 2003, ""You're not an enemy combatant. You're a terrorist. You're not a soldier in any war. To give you that reference, to call you a soldier gives you far too much stature. We do not negotiate with terrorists. We hunt them down one by one and bring them to justice.""

That's a different attitude than the one you're talking about. Some people say that by making somebody like Shahzad, who is certainly less successful than several of the mobsters you put away, who did far more heinous things than Shahzad actually was able to accomplish, but were tried in a criminal court, they say that what you're proposing would elevate somebody like Shahzad.

GIULIANI: Well, that's absurd, of course. I mean, you get more rights as a civilian defendant than you do as an enemy combatant, so that's a matter of semantics. Maybe you're giving them more status in terms of semantics, but you're giving them less rights, which is really important.

I mean, look at this whole thing with Senator Lieberman's recommendation that citizenship be revoked and look at the reluctance of the attorney general to support that. It shows a sort of sense of, I don't know, not understanding the magnitude of the problem.

I mean, why shouldn't we revoke the citizenship of someone who's been designated the -- an agent of a foreign -- of a foreign power or an agent of a -- of a terrorist group? Of course we should. Of course we should be able to revoke it. And I'd be happy to test the constitutionality of that.

Instead we have an attorney general who's studying that, also. They're at war with us, and we're spending time studying what rights they have. This doesn't make much sense, Jake. We're worried more about the rights of the terrorists, it seems -- or at least pondering that -- more than we are urgency about actually curing some of these things that will keep us safe and not have us rely on luck, which is how we got -- got through these last two ones.

TAPPER: We only have a little bit more time. I want to just get your reaction to what happened in Utah yesterday where Senator Bob Bennett, conservative Republican, lost his party primary. Are you worried at all that the Republican Party is not only growing more hostile to more liberal to moderate Republicans such as yourself, but also conservative Republicans who are shown to -- at least shown an ability to work with Democrats?

GIULIANI: No, I don't think so. I think the reality is that the Republican Party is very much based on its core principles. I think it's operating from its core principles. And I think that at this point, you know, President Obama has pushed the envelope so far that Republican Party wants to have candidates who are going to be -- be effective in standing up to the administration's inexorable march toward European social democracy.

I mean, I -- I see an administration that both in terms of economics and in terms of foreign policy, national security, seems to be moving us in the direction of European social democracy, with government taking over large segments of our -- of our economy, from car companies to banks to the energy industry, which they're trying to do, their health care industry, regulated in a minute (ph) way, the way the social democracies will -- which largely have failed in Europe -- have been doing now for -- you know, for several generations.

TAPPER: All right. Unfortunately...

GIULIANI: We need Republicans who are ideologically committed to standing up against that and really moving us in a different direction. I think that's what you see going on with the Tea Party movement. I think that's what you see going on in these -- in these elections.

TAPPER: All right, wonderful. Thank you so much, Mayor Giuliani. That's all the time we have.

GIULIANI: Thank you, Jake. Always nice to talk to you.

TAPPER: Appreciate it. Nice talking to you, sir.

The roundtable is next with George Will, Robin Wright, Shelby Steele, and John Podesta. And later, the Sunday funnies.

TAPPER: Scenes from the flash crash on Thursday. We'll get to the economy and the Greek debt crisis in a second with our roundtable. As always, George Will, Shelby Steele, author and a gentleman from the Hoover Institution, former Clinton White House chief of staff John Podesta of the Center for American Progress, and author and journalist Robin Wright of the center -- of the Institute of Peace. Did I get that right...

WRIGHT: U.S. Institute for Peace.

TAPPER: U.S. Institute for Peace. I'm sorry. I have so many organizations in my head.

We're going to get to the economy in a second, but I want to start with national security, given the conversations we just had with Attorney General Holder and Mayor Giuliani. George, what does this attempted terrorist attack say to you? What's the message from the attempted Times Square attack?

WILL: It is that the Pakistan connection, if true, is good news in the sense that it indicates the decline of the tradecraft of terrorism over time. The underwear bomber at Christmas and this man, also, are staggeringly incompetent and minor league figures compared to the amazing precision and scale of the 9/11 attacks.

Probably credit goes to both the Bush and the Obama administration for the extraordinary pressure with the drone attacks and all the rest that are being put on the Taliban and other supporters who are now footloose and having trouble coordinating.

The bad news -- if there is bad news in this -- is the targeting of Times Square. Let me tell you a story. Right after 9/11, I asked Jack Valenti, the late Jack Valenti, then chairman of the motion picture association, if he worried that someone might target Universal Studios as a symbol of Western decadence. He said, no, what worries me is six backpack bombs in six cineplexes around the country on a Saturday night. That would put huge economic damage on the movie industry. The question is, have they begun to figure that out?

TAPPER: Shelby, the ideology of Islamism still seems to be powerful even if the quality, the candidates of terrorists that the Pakistani Taliban and others are getting are not as good. The ideology seems just as strong. This guy lived, Faisal Shahzad, who we should say is innocent until proven guilty, but he's lived in the United States and had not a bad life here.

STEELE: Right, right. No, I think the ideology is the -- is the story. It's -- there's a larger clash, I think in the world, between the third world, people who were formally oppressed and so forth, who coming into freedom experience that as shame and came in, really, into a sort of confrontation with their own inferiority, their sense of inferiority. And I think jihadism is an ideology that compensates for a sense of inferiority.

And that's really its appeal. It has no real religious connection. These are not particularly religious people. But they're people who, as they -- as they sort of move into modernity, fail or having a rough time making that kind of transition, and so therefore there's this wonderful ideology based in the idea of killing people, of death, you know, if I put on the gun on the table now, I'm the most powerful man in the -- in the room. I'm not inferior anymore.

And it's that -- sort of the grandiosity of administering death randomly is extremely attractive to people who -- who had this inner sense that I'm just never going to make that -- that move into modernity.

TAPPER: John, I want to play some sound for you from House Minority Leader John Boehner talking on Thursday about this attempted attack.

PODESTA: OK.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BOEHNER: Yes, we've been lucky, but luck is not an effective strategy for fighting the terrorist threat. This is a nation at war. And stopping at nothing to confront and defeating the terrorist threat, this is how we best protect the American people and set an example for the rest of the world.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

TAPPER: You heard the attorney general. There was some luck at stake here. How do you see Republicans responding to this?

PODESTA: Well, you know, Widair (ph) said let's take advantage of it, the Republican pollster. I think you see John Boehner there. Nobody can even pause for a second to give credit to the New York City police, to the -- to the FBI, to the customs bureau for what was really a rapid roll-up of this guy, pulling him off the plane and putting him into custody, getting now him to talk.

So I think that they're almost -- they're on the verge of rooting for failure here, because I think they want to damage Obama so badly. And I think that that's tragic for the country.

And, you know, it seems to me that what they need to do is to recognize success, to push the system to do a better job. I think one of the things that George said is relevant, I think, which is that there's more pressure now on the Pakistani Taliban because of more effective strategy that's being employed in Pakistan, but that means that we're likely to be confronted with -- with more threat.

And I think it's time for the Republicans to get on board and try to find at least in this space -- I can understand it on -- you know, they almost root for failure on the economy side, as -- as well. They, you know, describe the job number, for example, on Friday as bad news, 290,000 jobs. But this is, I think, beyond the pale.

TAPPER: Robin, what are your sources telling you about Faisal Shahzad and his involvement with the Pakistani Taliban?

WRIGHT: Well, apparently, he's singing like a bird, I was told",0

politifact14954,"82-Year-Old Who Killed A Muslim In Self-Defense Gets The Death Penalty82-year-old William DeLisle of Marina Del Ray, California, has been sentenced to death for defending himself against a life-threatening situation. In October of 2015, DeLisle was walking home from the local senior center when he was ambushed by a pair of young Muslims.

The men, Abdi Nadjeer Hallalla and Mustif Salabu, were already wanted for a crime spree that spanned nearly four years with dozens of victims. They preyed on older Americans, often grabbing them off the street to beat and rob them. Until they met DeLisle.

Now, Hallalla is in a wheelchair breathing through a tube and Salabu is dead. DeLisle, who stormed the beach at Normandy as a young man, responded to the young men like any good Marine would. He pulled a .22 from his ankle holster — which is “illegal” in California — and put both men down in seconds.

Prosecutors said that because the two men were unarmed and using threats instead of actually hurting DeLisle meant that there was no imminent danger and that the use of deadly force was “extreme and unnecessary.” The Dewey County Prosecutor explained in a press release:

“Mr. DeLisle could have handed over his wallet without incident. Instead, he chose to pull an illegally carried firearm from a concealed location and shot the two men. Had he stopped there it may not have been such a major incident, as both men’s initial wounds were superficial.

While they were on the ground, DeLisle told Salabu that if he didn’t ‘denounce his pagan moon god, Allah, that he would be meeting him. Salabu closed his eyes to pray and DeLisle put two bullets in his skull.

Hallalla, after seeing his friend murdered, tried to flee and was shot in the spine, paralizing him for life. This wasn’t self-defense. It was murder and religious persecution.”

Religious persecution? How much you want to bet if the tables were turned and an elderly Muslim killed two Christian men trying to mug him he’d get a medal from the Governor of California?

DeLisle has nothing to be concerned with, since the pansies in California don’t actually execute prisoners. They have a moratorium on their useless death penalty and have for decades. He will, however, die in prison. His lawyer said DeLisle expressed that it was a “small price to pay if he saved others from these two monsters.”

DeLisle hasn’t asked for an appeal.

politifact118,"Infrastructure Report Card 2005

» Printer Friendly

ASCE's 2005 Report Card for America's Infrastructure assessed the condition and capacity of our nation's public works with an overall grade of D. ASCE estimates that $1.6 trillion is needed over a five-year period to bring the nation's infrastructure to good condition. While long term solutions are needed, in the short term, small steps can be taken by the 110th Congress to improve our nation's failing infrastructure.











The Cost

The estimated total need of $1.6 trillion in federal, state and local funds is not all new money. Much of it is already allocated in existing budgets. However, existing funds have been repeatedly raided to pay for other programs. We estimate that approximately one-third of the total current investment needed will be new funding. It is also important to remember that the $1.6 trillion does not account for future population growth.



Case studies of failing infrastructure . . .



Kauai, Hawaii - March 2006

Seven people were killed when an earthen dam failed, unleashing nearly 300 million gallons of water, smashing down trees and sweeping away homes.



Portland, Oregon - December 2006

A clogged sewer line caused a sink hole in Portland which swallowed a truck-which had been sent to clean the sewer. Natural gas and water lines were also ruptured in the accident.



Washington County, Pennsylvania - December 2005

A 120-ton concrete beam collapsed onto Interstate 70 in Washington County, Pa., barely missing passing motorists. According to FHWA, 39 percent of bridges in Pennsylvania are unsafe.



Atlanta, Georgia

Congestion on Atlanta's roads costs the individual commuter 67 hours in wasted time each year and more than $1.7 billion, according to the Texas Transportation Institute.



Action Steps

National Infrastructure Commission





Congress must enact the National Infrastructure Improvement Act to establish the National Commission on Infrastructure of the United States.



The Commission would study the present condition of the nation's various infrastructure systems and report to Congress by 2009 on the capacity of our infrastructure to support the national economy, the age of the systems and possible methods to finance improvements.





Aviation





Congress must reauthorize funding for the Airport and Airway Trust Fund and enact an increase in user fees as necessary for continued funding of the Airport Improvement Program.



The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems estimates that over the next five years (2005-2009) $39.5 billion will be needed to meet the infrastructure demands of all segments of civil aviation. In March 2005, the FAA forecasted total passenger enplanements would surpass 1 billion annually within the next ten years, representing a 41 percent increase from 2005. The current funding authority expires October 1, 2007, and with the projected increase in passenger traffic, airports are at risk for seasonal and peak-period delays.





Bridges, Roads & Transit





Congress must fully fund surface transportation programs authorized under SAFETEA-LU.



Congress must use all funds that accumulate in the Highway Trust Fund to invest in the nation's surface transportation program.



Poor road conditions cost U.S. motorists $54 billion a year in repairs and operating costs?$275 per motorist- and congestion on the nation's roadways costs drivers $63.1 billion a year. However, the $59.4 billion spent annually is well below the $94 billion needed each year to improve transportation infrastructure conditions nationally. Also, in 2004, Americans took 9.6 billion trips using public transportation. Since 1995, public transportation ridership in the U.S. has grown by more than 23 percent, faster than highway travel.





Brownfields





Congress must reauthorize the Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of 2002 in order to provide continued federal funding for the redevelopment of brownfields sites.



According to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, 172 cities estimated that they collectively have more than 23,810 brownfields sites, with the average size of a brownfield site being between five and 15 acres. Also, 158 cities collectively estimated that their brownfield properties comprised 96,039 acres of land, representing potential new jobs and land tax revenue.





Dams & Levees





Congress must enact the Dam Rehabilitation and Repair Act (H.R. 1098) to address the most critical non-federal public dams.



Congress must enact a national levee safety program, including a nationwide inventory of levees and mandatory inspection requirements.



State dam safety officials estimate that $10 billion is needed to repair the most critical dams over the next 12 years. Also, state dam safety programs have identified more than 3,500 unsafe or deficient dams, many of which are susceptible to large flood events or earthquakes.



The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reported in early 2007 that nearly 150 U.S. levees pose an unacceptable risk of failing in a major flood, mainly due to poor maintenance. The nation cannot afford to wait for another flooding catastrophe like the one that followed Hurricane Katrina in 2005.





Drinking Water & Wastewater





Congress must enact the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007 (H.R. 720) to provide vitally needed federal aid through the State Revolving Loan Fund (CWSRF) program.



Congress must authorize $1 billion in annual funding for the Safe Drinking Water Act State Revolving Loan Fund (DWSRF).



The EPA estimates that nearly $1 trillion is needed in critical drinking water and wastewater investments over the next two decades. At risk are the gains that have been made in cleaning up the nation's rivers, lakes, and streams since the enactment of the Clean Water Act in 1972.





Inland Waterways





Congress must enact a Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) that requires a more comprehensive approach to water resources projects constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.



Congress must ensure the integrity of the Inland Waterways Trust Fund.



Of the 257 locks on the more than 12,000 miles of inland waterways operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, nearly 50 percent are functionally obsolete. By 2020, that number will increase to 80 percent. The cost to replace the present system of locks is more than $125 billion.



ASCE's 2005 Report Card for America's Infrastructure assessed the condition and capacity of our nation's public works with an overall grade of D. ASCE estimates that $1.6 trillion is needed over a five-year period to bring the nation's infrastructure to good condition. While long term solutions are needed, in the short term, small steps can be taken by the 110th Congress to improve our nation's failing infrastructure.

As the figure shows, income for the median working-age household – where the householder is under 65 – dropped by $4,184 between 2007 and 2010. Furthermore, the Great Recession came on the heels of one of the worst business cycles (2000-2007) on record in terms of job creation, one in which the income of the median working-age household fell $2,113.

Thus, the typical working-age household brought in roughly $6,300 less in 2010 than it did in 2000, a more than 10 percent decline. A lost decade, indeed.

politifact409,"Bill Clinton Says He 'Never Said A Bad Word About Senator Obama,' At mtvU's First 'Editorial Board'On Sunday, former President Bill Clinton — whose wife, Senator Hillary Clinton, is battling for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination — fielded some tough questions from four college journalists during mtvU's ""Editorial Board"" in New Orleans. The Clinton installment of ""Editorial Board"" premieres March 26 on mtvU.

While the questions were largely expected, Clinton's answers were not. The event — the first in a televised series that will give selected writers and editors from mtvU's College Media Network the opportunity to meet with some of today's most prominent political figures — provided Clinton an opportunity to set the record straight.

When asked about those remarks he'd made leading up to the South Carolina primary (he pointedly compared Senator Barack Obama's candidacy to that of Jesse Jackson's in '84 and '88, which some perceived as his attempt to pigeonhole his wife's rival as the ""black"" candidate), Clinton said his remarks were blown out of proportion by a media hungry for controversy during election season.

""Contrary to the myth, I went through South Carolina and never said a bad word about Senator Obama — not one,"" he insisted. ""I went to African-American college campuses and said, 'Look, I expect most of you are going to vote against Hillary. But I want you to know that she wants your vote.' That's what we did. You can't blame the African-American community for being proud of having a candidate who's immensely impressive, who has had a lot of support in the North among non-African-Americans and has generated all this excitement among young people. I don't think it's rocket science. The fact that people are excited about Senator Obama's candidacy in the African-American community is entirely understandable.""

But Clinton warned against approaching this election as though it were a popularity contest. He said while thousands of Americans have rallied around Obama's call for change, his wife has been making change for years.

""It is almost impossible to find any Democrat who has accomplished more in less time in the Senate — and with Republicans — on both domestic and foreign-policy issues and military issues"" than Hillary Clinton, he said. Bill Clinton also said that Obama has been running a campaign that suggests, ""If you were part of making good things happen in the '90s and stopping bad things from happening in this decade ... then you are part of a culture of conflict and you are so yesterday. The only way we can have a good president is to make a completely new beginning.

""This is the first election in history that I can remember where experience — and having, actually, experience as a change-maker — should be a disability for being elected,"" he added. ""All of you who are young have a right to say that, but don't pretend you're not saying that.""

Later, Clinton took exception to suggestions that Obama has rejected special-interest funds in his campaign. ""[Obama] was the only one who kept his [political action committee],"" Clinton said. ""Then, in the beginning, he spends 40 percent of the PAC money — 43 percent, to be exact — on Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina politicians. Those states constitute 3.7 percent of America's population. He also admitted that his political action committee consulted with his campaign on how to spread the money out. So, therefore, it is not true that he has run a campaign without any special-interest money influencing the presidential campaign.""

When asked why African-Americans' support of his wife continues to drop, Clinton pointed to Obama's caucus win in Iowa as the turning point — not the comments he made before South Carolina's primary.

""The minute it became possible that [Obama] could be the nominee, he was going to win the lion's share of the African-American vote,"" Clinton surmised. ""And I think that I never begrudged it.""

The issue of drug use was also broached. Clinton famously remarked in the '90s that he had experimented with marijuana but ""never inhaled,"" and Obama has also admitted to trying cocaine as a youth. Clinton was asked whether voters might be swayed by such things from a candidate's past.

""It was also an issue when President Bush ran for the first time, because he didn't answer the cocaine question, right? ... I think the voters rendered a verdict ... that what you did when you were really young is not going to bar you from serving as president,"" he said.

Clinton later told the crowd assembled for Sunday's event that he thinks Congress may abolish the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy regarding gays serving in the military before year's end.

""It would have been a better policy if it had been implemented the way General [Colin] Powell and I agreed to implement it. ... I think we may have the support now in Congress to get rid of it altogether,"" Clinton said. ""That's what we should do. We should do what every other major country has done and allow gays to serve honorably in the military. ... Our guys came to us and said, 'Look. If you don't agree to this, they're going to bury you. You will have nothing.' ""

politifact323,"Change We Can Believe InRemarks of Senator Barack Obama: The Past Versus the Future

Denver, CO | January 30, 2008



Thank you Caroline - for your introduction, your support, and your lifetime of service to a grateful nation. You continue to inspire Americans of all ages and walks of life.

Let me also say a few words about another American who has called us to a common purpose. John Edwards has spent a lifetime fighting to give voice to the voiceless and hope to the struggling. At a time when our politics is too focused on who's up and who's down, he made us focus on who matters - the New Orleans child without a home, the West Virginia miner without a job, the families who live in that other America that is not seen or heard or talked about in Washington. John and Elizabeth Edwards believe deeply that two Americans can become one. Their campaign may have ended, but this cause lives on for all of us who believe that we can achieve one America.

Seven months from now, the Democratic Party will gather here in Denver to nominate our candidate for President of the United States.

We will come together after a long and hard fought primary campaign - and that's a good thing. Because it is through campaigns that we hear directly from the American people, set our common goals, and debate our differences. It is through campaigns that we bring new people into the process; build new coalitions; and renew who we are and what we stand for as a Party.

It is fitting that the journey leads to Denver - a city that is younger than the Democratic Party itself, but filled with the promise that our Party has always fought for. This city, built at the base of the Rocky Mountains, stands as a monument to a uniquely American belief in things unseen. Here, in Denver, fur trappers and traders; gold rushers and ranchers; came in search of opportunity, and made the future their own.

The story of America leads west. It is a story of ideals that know no boundaries. It is a story of immigrants who set out from distant shores; pioneers who persevered; and people of all races, religions, and ethnic groups who put aside their doubts to seek a new frontier.

My own family's journey moved west - from Kansas, where my grandparents met and married, and my mother was born; to the Pacific Coast after World War II; and then across an ocean to Hawaii. Their journey - like so many others - speaks to a simple truth written into the story of America. It's a truth at the foundation of the Democratic Party's purpose, Denver's progress, and our nation's promise: in America, the future is what we decide it's going to be.

As candidates, we must give new meaning to that promise. And seven months from now, one of us will stand before that convention hall, and give voice to the hopes, and dreams, and determination of Americans all across our country. In six days, you get to choose who will be that voice. You get to choose who will be able to build a new majority of not just Democrats - but Independents and Republicans - to win in November, and transform our country. And if you put your trust in me, I will stand up at that convention and say that our divisions are past, our hope is the future, and our time for change has come.

Now there is one thing we know for certain about the election in November: the name George Bush will not be on the ballot. The name of my cousin - Dick Cheney - will not be on the ballot. But the choice before you is about what comes next. Because we need to do more than turn the page on the failed Bush-Cheney policies; we have to turn the page on the politics that helped make those policies possible.

Lobbyists setting an agenda in Washington that feeds the inequality, insecurity, and instability in our economy.

Division and distraction that keeps us from coming together to deal with challenges like health care, and clean energy, and crumbling schools year after year after year.

Cronyism that gave us Katrina instead of competent government. And secrecy that made torture permissible and illegal wiretaps possible.

It's a politics that uses 9/11 to scare up votes; and fear and falsehoods to lead us into a war in Iraq that should've never been authorized and should've never been waged.

Each candidate running for the Democratic nomination shares an abiding desire to end the disastrous policies of the current administration. But we must decide - in the debate that leads to Denver - just what kind of Party we want to be, and what lessons we've learned from the bitter partisanship of the last two decades. We can be a Party that tries to beat the other side by practicing the same do-anything, say-anything, divisive politics that has stood in the way of progress; or we can be a Party that puts an end to it.

I am running for President because I believe that we need fundamental change in America. Not just a change of Party in the White House, but change in Washington that the American people can believe in - unity instead of division; hope instead of fear; a politics that leaves behind the fights of the past so that we can finally take hold of our future.

We began this campaign one year ago on the steps of the old statehouse in Springfield. At the time, we made a bet on the American people. That bet was simple - we weren't going to change anything by relying on the same Washington games; instead, we were betting on the American people's hunger for change, and your ability to make change happen from the bottom-up.

And we are showing America what change looks like. From the snows of Iowa to the sunshine of South Carolina, we have built a movement of young and old; rich and poor; black and white; Latino, Asian and Native American. We've reached Americans of all political stripes who are more interested in turning the page than turning up the heat on our opponents. That's how Democrats will win in November and build a majority in Congress. Not by nominating a candidate who will unite the other party against us, but by choosing one who can unite this country around a movement for change.

If you choose change, you will have a nominee who doesn't take a dime from Washington lobbyists and PACs. We don't need a candidate who agrees with Republicans that lobbyists are part of the system in Washington. They're part of the problem. And when I'm President, their days of setting the agenda in Washington will be over.

If you choose change, you will have a nominee who doesn't just tell people what they want to hear. Poll-tested positions and calculated answers might be how Washington confronts challenges, but it's not how you overcome them; it's not how you inspire our nation to come together behind a common purpose; and it's not what America needs right now.

If you choose change, you will have a nominee who isn't just playing on the same electoral map where half the country starts out against us, because you will have a nominee who has already brought in more Independents and Republicans; young people and new voters; than we have seen in a generation.

I know it is tempting - after another presidency by a man named George Bush - to simply turn back the clock, and to build a bridge back to the 20th Century. There are those will tell us that our Party should nominate someone who is more practiced in the art of pursuing power; that's it's not yet our turn or our time. There was also a time when Caroline Kennedy's father was counseled by a former President to “be patient,” and to step aside for “someone with greater experience.” But John F. Kennedy responded by saying, “The world is changing. The old ways will not do…It is time for a new generation of leadership.”

It is time for a new generation of leadership, because the old politics just won't do. I am running for President - right now - because I have met Americans all across this country who cannot afford to wait another day for change. That is why the real choice in this campaign is not between regions or religions or genders. It's not about rich versus poor; young versus old; and it is not about black versus white.

It is about the past versus the future. And when I am the nominee, the Republicans won't be able to make this election about the past because you will have already chosen the future.

It's time for new leadership for an economy where families are being forced to foreclose on their dreams, and workers have seen their pensions disappear.

In the short-term, we need what I have consistently called for - a stimulus plan that gives the American people a tax rebate, and that also extends relief to seniors and expands unemployment insurance. And in the long-term, we need to put the American Dream on a firmer foundation. We're not going to offer the American people the choice they need by nominating a candidate who voted to put the banks and big business ahead of hard-working Americans. I've been fighting for working people my entire public life. And when I am President, I'll make sure that CEOs can't dump your pension with one hand while they collect a bonus with the other. I'll pass bankruptcy laws that protect workers instead of banks. And I'll crack down on fraudulent mortgage lenders, and credit card companies that change your rates to push you further into debt.

It's time for new leadership for the Maytag worker who is now competing with his own teenage son for a $7 an-hour job at Walmart because the factory he gave his life to shut its doors.

We're not going to offer the American people the choice they need by nominating a candidate who argues year after year for trade that isn't fair, but calls for a time-out on trade when they run for President. I will stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship our jobs overseas and start putting them in the pockets of working Americans. I will stop giving the wealthiest Americans tax cuts that they don't need and didn't ask for, and restore fairness to our economy. I'll give a tax cut to working people; provide relief to homeowners; and eliminate the income tax for seniors making under $50,000 so they can retire with the dignity and security they have earned.

It's time for new leadership for the woman I met who can't get Medicaid to cover the needs of her sick child.

She can't afford to wait another four years or another fifteen years to get health care because we've put forward a nominee who can't bring Democrats and Republicans together to get things done. I know that the reason Americans don't have health care isn't because no one is forcing them to buy it - it's because they can't afford it. That's why my plan cuts costs by up to $2500 for a typical family, and makes health care available and affordable for every single American. That's the plan that I'll pass in my first term as President.

It is time for new leadership for children going to overcrowded schools in East L.A.; for the teacher I met who is working at Dunkin Donuts to make ends meet; for the young people who are ready to go to college but can't afford it.

When I'm President, we'll rally this country to the cause of world-class education. That means putting our kids on a pathway to success with universal, quality, affordable early childhood education. That means paying our teachers more, and making sure they're not just teaching to the test - but teaching art and music and literature. That means giving our young people an annual $4,000 tax credit for college tuition if they serve their community; and that means expanding AmeriCorps to 250,000 slots, and issuing a call to service for a new generation. But that also means calling on parents to do their part - to get off the couch, turn off the television, and read to our children. Because responsibility for education starts at home.

It's time for new leadership so that my daughters and your children don't grow up in a century where our economy is weighed down by our addiction to oil; our foreign policy is held hostage to the whims of dictators; and our planet passes a moment of no return.

When I'm President, we won't wait any longer to reduce emissions. When I called for higher fuel efficiency standards, I didn't do it in front of an environmental group in California or in Boulder - that would have been the easy thing to do. I did it in front of the automakers in Detroit. Now it was pretty quiet - I didn't get a lot of applause. But we need leadership that tells the American people not just what they want to hear, but what we need to know. That's what I'll do. We cannot wait to invest in the next generation of biofuels, and wind and solar. If President Kennedy could send us to the moon in less than a decade - then we can meet this great challenge our generation. We can set the goal of an 80% reduction in global emissions by 2050, and we can lead the world to confront the climate crisis.

And it's time for new leadership for the woman who told me that she hasn't been able to breathe since the day her nephew left for Iraq, and the soldier who doesn't know his own child because he's on his third or fourth tour of duty.

I will end the mentality that says the only way for Democrats to look tough on national security is by talking, acting and voting like George Bush Republicans. It's time to reject the counsel that says the American people would rather have someone who is strong and wrong than someone who is weak and right - it's time to say that we are the Party that is going to be strong and right.

It's time for new leadership that understands that the way to win a debate with John McCain is not by nominating someone who agreed with him on voting for the war in Iraq; who agreed with him by voting to give George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran; who agrees with him in embracing the Bush-Cheney policy of not talking to leaders we don't like; and who actually differed with him by arguing for exceptions for torture before changing positions when the politics of the moment changed.

We need to offer the American people a clear contrast on national security, and when I am the nominee of the Democratic Party, that's exactly what I will do. Talking tough and tallying up your years in Washington is no substitute for judgment, and courage, and clear plans. It's not enough to say you'll be ready from Day One - you have to be right from Day One.

I opposed this war in Iraq from the start, and I have never, ever wavered in that opposition. I warned about taking our eye off of Osama bin Laden, and overstretching our troops and their families as we have seen in communities across this country like Fort Carson. And when I am President, I will immediately begin to remove our troops, I will finally put meaningful pressure on Iraq's leaders to reconcile, and I will end this war. And I will do what we should have done back in 2002: increase our commitment to Afghanistan, press Pakistan to take action against terror, and finish the fight with al Qaeda.

I will challenge the conventional thinking that says we can't conduct diplomacy with leaders we don't like. Strong countries and strong Presidents talk to their adversaries as well as their friends, and that's what I'll do. And when I am President, we will keep nuclear weapons from terrorists by securing all loose nuclear materials around the world during my first term in office. We will set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons, and we will pursue it.

It's time for new leadership that reaches out, as President Kennedy did to my own father, to people “in the huts and villages across the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery.”

It's time to restore our moral leadership by rejecting torture without equivocation; by closing Guantanamo; by restoring habeas corpus; and by again being that light of justice to dissidents in prison camps around the globe. It's time for America to lead the world against the common threats of the 21st century - terrorism and nuclear weapons, but also climate change and poverty; genocide and disease. I will send once more a message to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says, “You matter to us. Your future is our future. And our moment is now.”

This is what the moment demands of us - to cast off our doubts; to reach once more for what America can be if we have the courage to make the future our own.

We've been warned, in these last few weeks, that this kind of change isn't possible. That we're peddling false hopes. That we need a reality check.

And we've faced forces that are not the fault of any one campaign - forces that open American wounds. The politics that uses religion as a wedge, and patriotism as a bludgeon. A politics that tells us what we have to think and even vote within the confines of the categories that supposedly define us. The assumption that young people are apathetic. The assumption that Republicans won't cross over. The assumption that the wealthy care nothing for the poor, and that the poor don't vote. The assumption that African-Americans can't support the white candidate; whites can't support the African-American candidate; and blacks and Latinos can't come together.

But our Party - the Democratic Party - has always been at its best when we rose above these divisions; when we called all Americans to a common purpose, a higher purpose; when we stood up and said that we will write our own future, and the future will be what we want it to be.

We followed a King to the mountaintop, and a Kennedy who called on us to reject the mindless menace of violence.

We're the party of a young President who asked what we could do for our country, and who put us on a path to the moon.

We're the party of a man who overcame his own disability; who told us that the only thing we had to fear was fear itself; and who faced down fascism and liberated a continent from tyranny.

We're the party of Jackson, who took back the White House for the people of this country.

And we're the party of Jefferson, who wrote the words that we are still trying to heed - that all of us are created equal - and who sent us West to blaze new trails, to make new discoveries, and to realize the promise of our highest ideals.

That is who we are. That is the Party that we need to be, and can be, if we cast off our doubts, and leave behind our fears, and choose the America that we know is possible. Because there is a moment in the life of every generation, if it is to make its mark on history, when its spirit has to come through, when it must choose the future over the past, when it must make its own change from the bottom up.

This is our moment. This is our message - the same message we had when we were up, and when we were down. The same message that we will carry all the way to the convention. And in seven months time - right here in Denver - we can realize this promise; we can claim this legacy; we can choose new leadership for America. Because there is nothing we cannot do if the American people decide it is time.",0
politifact12148,"Remarks on counterterrorism at Stanford UniversityIn the aftermath of the terrorist attack in Brussels, Hillary Clinton highlighted that now is a time for steady leadership, when we must stand in solidarity with our European allies and respond firmly to defeat ISIS in a speech on counterterrorism at Stanford University.

Thank you. Thank you very much, Mike, thank you for the introduction, but—more than that—for your service to our country, and our partnership during the four years I served as secretary of state. What happens in Vladivostok stays in Vladivostok.

I am delighted to be back here at Stanford. And I will never forget the day that we first brought Chelsea here. I brought her to visit when she was thinking about schools, but I knew as soon as she saw Stanford that this is where, if she were fortunate enough to be admitted, she would certainly choose to come. And, of course, I remember when Bill and I brought her here to begin her freshman year, and then the dinner for parents that Mike was referring to. So it’s a great treat to be back.

And now that my daughter is a mother herself—you can imagine—there’s already talk, at least among one or two members of our family, since her husband is also an alum of Stanford, about how good Charlotte would look one day in Cardinal red.

I am delighted to be here with some very distinguished guests. Secretary Shultz, Secretary Perry, thank you both for being here with us. Lanny, thank you. Marcos, thank you, and others. It’s really a great treat for me to be not only at the university, but at this particular institute as well. You have really made Stanford a center for national security scholarship, and that is the principle reason why I am here today.

Yesterday’s attack in Brussels was the latest brutal reminder that our fight against ISIS and radical jihadist terrorism is far from finished.

More than 30 innocent people are dead—men and women, hurrying to catch a plane, or waiting for a train, or meeting a loved one. Hundreds more are wounded, including three Mormon missionaries from Utah; a U.S. Air Force officer, his wife and four children; and other Americans.

It’s understandable that Americans here at home are worried. The threat we face from terrorism is real, it’s urgent, and it knows no boundaries. Even as Brussels grieves, the memories of Paris and San Bernardino are painfully fresh as well. On Saturday, a bombing in Istanbul killed four people, including two U.S.-Israeli dual citizens. Many other places have been targeted by terrorists in the past year alone. Hotels in West Africa. Beaches in Tunisia. A market in Lebanon. A Russian passenger jet in the Sinai.

ISIS is attempting a genocide of religious and ethnic minorities. It beheads civilians. It enslaves, tortures, and rapes women and girls.

Walls will not protect us from this threat. We cannot contain ISIS—we must defeat ISIS.

This will be one of the most important challenges facing the next president, who takes office on January 20. Our new commander in chief will walk into the Oval Office and find a world of hard choices and complex problems. That president will sit down at that desk and start making decisions that will affect the lives—and livelihoods—of every American, and people around the world.

So, the stakes could not be higher.

Today, I want to emphasize three points.

First, we face an adversary that is constantly adapting and operating across multiple theaters, so our response must be just as nimble and far-reaching.

Second, to defeat this transnational threat, we need to reinforce the alliances that have been core pillars of American power for decades.

And third, we need to rely on what actually works—not bluster that alienates our partners and doesn’t make us any safer.

Let’s begin by being clear about what we are facing: ISIS controls a shrinking but still sizeable territory in Iraq and Syria. It leads a far-flung network that includes affiliates across the Middle East and North Africa, and cells in Europe, Asia, and even here in North America. It’s also part of a broader ideological movement that includes other terrorist groups.

We need to do battle on all these fronts.

Last year, in speeches in New York and Minneapolis, I laid out a three-part plan to defeat ISIS in the Middle East, around the world, and here at home. Recent events have only reinforced the urgency of this mission.

First, we do have to take out ISIS’ stronghold in Iraq and Syria.

We should intensify the coalition air campaign against its fighters, leaders, and infrastructure; step up support for local Arab and Kurdish forces on the ground and coalition efforts to protect civilians; and pursue a diplomatic strategy aimed at achieving political resolutions to Syria’s civil war and Iraq’s sectarian divide.

Second, we must dismantle the global network of terror that supplies money, arms, propaganda, and fighters. This means targeted efforts to deal with ISIS affiliates, from Libya to Afghanistan. It means going after the key enablers who facilitate illicit financial transactions and help jihadists arrange travel, forge documents, and evade detection. And it means waging online battles with extremists to discredit their ideology, expose their lies, and counter their appeals to potential recruits in the West and around the world.

Third, we must harden our defenses and build our resilience here at home. We need to counter each step in the process that can lead to an attack, deterring would-be terrorists and discovering and disrupting plots before they’re carried out.

Our enemies are constantly adapting, so we have to do the same. For example, Brussels demonstrated, clearly, we need to take a harder look at security protocols at airports and other sensitive so-called “soft sites,” especially areas outside guarded perimeters.

To do all this, we need an intelligence surge—and so do our allies.

We also have to stay ahead of the curve technologically. That does mean working with the brightest minds here in Silicon Valley to more effectively track and analyze ISIS’s social media posts and map jihadist networks online. When other candidates talk about building walls around America, I want to ask them: How high does the wall have to be to keep the internet out?

And we also have to tackle a thorny challenge that is top-of-mind here in the Bay Area: navigating the security and civil liberties concerns surrounding the encryption of mobile devices and communications.

Impenetrable encryption provides significant cybersecurity advantages, but may also make it harder for law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals to investigate plots and prevent future attacks. ISIS knows this, too. At the same time, there are legitimate worries about privacy, network security, and creating new vulnerabilities that bad actors—including terrorists—can exploit.

There may be no quick or magic fix. In the Apple case, the FBI may have found a work-around—but there will be future cases, with different facts and different challenges. So the tech community and the government have to stop seeing each other as adversaries and start working together to protect our safety and our privacy. A National Commission on Encryption, like Senator Mark Warner and Congressman Mike McCaul are proposing, could help. And our security professionals could use the advice and talents of technology professionals to help us figure out how we do stay ahead of the terrorists.

Our fight against radical jihadist terrorists will be long, and there is very real risk of future attacks here at home. But pursuing this comprehensive strategy will put us in the best position to defeat ISIS and keep our families and communities safe.

This is a very personal issue for me, having served as a Senator from New York on 9/11. Having seen the horrors that were produced by a well-planned and executed attack on our country. Knowing how important it is that we do stay ahead of those who wish to do us great harm, without panic, without paranoia—but with resolve not to give in to the very behavior the terrorists are hoping to engender.

We can’t let fear stop us from doing what’s necessary to keep us safe—nor can we let it push us into reckless actions that end up making us less safe.

For example, it would be a serious mistake to stumble into another costly ground war in the Middle East. If we’ve learned anything from Iraq and Afghanistan, it’s that people and nations have to secure their own communities. We can—I argue, must—support them, but we can’t substitute for them.

It would also be a serious mistake to begin “carpet bombing” populated areas “into oblivion.” Proposing that doesn’t make you sound tough—it makes you sound like you’re in over your head.

Slogans aren’t a strategy. Loose cannons tend to misfire. What America needs is strong, smart, steady leadership to wage and win this struggle.

To do that, we need to strengthen America’s alliances in Europe, Asia, and around the world. And that is the second point I want to emphasize.

On 9/11, NATO treated an attack against one as an attack against all. On September 12, headlines across Europe, most notably in Le Monde, proclaimed, “We are all Americans.” There were very few planes in the air that day—but one was a British jet carrying the UK’s top national security leaders to Washington to offer any help they could.

Now it’s our turn to stand with Europe. We cherish the same values and face the same adversaries—so we must share the same determination.

This is especially true at a time when Europe faces multiple overlapping crises—from President Putin’s aggression in Ukraine, to the massive influx of refugees, to continuing economic challenges, to the rise of right-wing nationalist parties. We have made so much progress together toward the goal of a Europe that is free, whole, and at peace—and we can’t risk letting it fall apart now.

For decades, Republican and Democratic administrations have understood that America’s alliances make us stronger. Secretary Shultz compared the slow, steady work of building diplomatic relationships to gardening. He knew that when you cultivate effective partners, you can harvest real rewards.

Allies extend our reach, share intelligence, provide troops in conflicts like Afghanistan, offer bases and staging areas around the world for our military, and serve as a bulwark against competitors like Russia and China. And, by the way, both Moscow and Beijing know our global network of alliances is a significant strategic advantage they can’t match.

NATO, in particular, is one of the best investments America has ever made. From the Balkans to Afghanistan and beyond, NATO allies have fought alongside the United States, sharing the burdens and the sacrifices. In the 1990s, Secretary Perry helped guide NATO’s expansion based on the alliance’s core tenets of collective defense, democracy, consensus, and cooperative security. They became known as the “Perry Principles,” and they’re still at the heart of what makes NATO the most successful alliance in history.

Turning our back on our alliances—or turning our alliance into a protection racket—would reverse decades of bipartisan American leadership and send a dangerous signal to friend and foe alike.

Putin already hopes to divide Europe. If Mr. Trump gets his way, it’ll be like Christmas in the Kremlin. It will make America less safe—and the world more dangerous.

When it comes to the struggle against ISIS, we need our allies as much as ever. We need them to be strong and engaged, for they are increasingly on the front lines. London, Paris, Madrid, Brussels, Istanbul—they’ve all been hit by terrorism. And, as we saw when a terrorist cell in Hamburg carried out the 9/11 attacks: What happens in Europe has a way of making it to America. So it’s essential that we have strong partners who can work with us to disrupt plots and dismantle networks in their own countries before they lead to attacks in ours.

America needs European intelligence services working hand-in-hand with our own, including where they may have better reach and expertise, like in North Africa. We need European banks to stop terrorist financing. We need European planes flying missions over Iraq and Syria, and European special forces helping train and equip local anti-ISIS forces on the ground.

We need European diplomats and development experts working to improve governance and reduce the appeal of extremism across the wide arc of instability that stretches from West Africa all the way to Asia; together, we can do more. And, more urgently, to support moderate voices and stand with Tunisians, Libyans, Kurds, and others in the region who are trying to do the right thing.

And as we should, of course, be closely consulting with Israel—our strongest ally in the Middle East—we also have to extend our consultations to Arab partners as well.

All of this will make America safer, and help defeat ISIS.

There is much we can do to support our European partners: helping them improve intelligence and law enforcement, facilitating information sharing, working more closely at every level. There’s also more they can do to share the burden with us. We’d like to see more European countries investing in defense and security, following the example Germany and others have set during the Obama administration.

The most urgent task is stopping the flow of foreign fighters to and from the Middle East. Thousands of young recruits have flocked to Syria from France, Germany, Belgium, and the United Kingdom. Their European passports make it easier for them to cross borders and eventually return home, radicalized and battle-hardened. We need to know the identities of every fighter who makes that trip and start revoking passports and visas.

Stemming this tide will require much better coordination among every country along the way. Right now, many European nations don’t even alert each other when they turn away a suspected jihadist at the border, or when a passport is stolen. And Turkey, a NATO ally, still has more work to do to control the border where most foreign fighters cross into Syria.

After the Paris attack, France and Belgium pledged to move forward together on reforms—but that’s difficult without the European Union. In January, the EU announced a new, integrated counterterrorism center, but intelligence cooperation still lags, and the EU keeps delaying a vote to share traveler information between member states. It’s actually easier for the United States to get flight manifests from EU nations than it is for EU nations to get them from their own neighbors, thanks to an agreement the U.S. negotiated when I was secretary of state.

There also has to be a special emphasis on identifying and investing in the hot spots—the specific neighborhoods, prisons, and schools where recruitment happens in clusters, as we’ve seen in Brussels. And it’s time to make good on the promise of establishing a new unified European Border and Coast Guard to strengthen the continent’s external borders, which are under unprecedented pressure from refugees and migrants.

Now, this is a heartbreaking crisis.

Last year, the world was horrified by the photo of a drowned toddler lying on a Turkish beach. In the months since then, hundreds more children have died trying to reach safety. We’ve seen Europe and Syria’s neighbors in the Middle East struggle under the weight of this challenge. It’s too big for any one country—or even continent—to handle alone. I’m glad that the EU and Turkey are now working closely together—and the United States should do whatever we can to support that.

The only truly effective answer is to go to the source: End the conflict that is displacing all these people. So we have to support and maintain the ceasefire in Syria. And we should also work with our coalition partners and opposition forces on the ground to create safe areas where Syrians can remain in the country rather than fleeing toward Europe.

In the meantime, it would be wrong to shut our doors to orphans or to apply religious tests for people fleeing persecution. That’s not who we are.

But of course we have to be vigilant in screening and vetting everyone. We can’t allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values and humanitarian obligations—but we also have to be smart and vigilant about how we process people into our country. It would be doubly cruel if ISIS can not only force families from their homes, and but also prevent them from ever finding new ones.

And that brings me to my third point: In our fight against radical jihadism, we have to do what actually works.

One thing we know that does not work is offensive, inflammatory rhetoric that demonizes all Muslims.

There are millions of peace-loving Muslims living, working, raising families, and paying taxes in this country. These Americans are a crucial line of defense against terrorism. They are the most likely to recognize the warning signs of radicalization before it’s too late, and the best positioned to block it.

Last year in Minneapolis, I met parents, teachers, imams, and others in the Somali-American community who are working with law enforcement and mental health professionals to intervene with young people at risk of being radicalized. Efforts like that deserve more local and national support.

Since 9/11, law enforcement has worked hard to build trustful and strong relationships with American Muslim communities. As the director of the FBI told Congress: Anything that erodes that trust makes their job more difficult.

We need every American community invested in this fight, not fearful and sitting on the sidelines.

So when Republican candidates like Ted Cruz call for treating American Muslims like criminals, and for racially profiling predominantly-Muslim neighborhoods, it’s wrong. It’s counterproductive. It’s dangerous.

As a spokesman for the New York Police Department pointed out last night, that kind of blanket bigotry would treat the city’s nearly 1,000 Muslim police officers as threats. “It’s hard to imagine a more incendiary, foolish statement,” he said.

Commissioner Bill Bratton of the NYPD was even more blunt this morning: He said Senator Cruz “doesn’t know what the hell he’s talking about.”

Demonizing Muslims also alienates partners and undermines moderates we need around the world in the fight against ISIS.

There’s been a lot of talk from both Republicans and Democrats about the importance of building coalitions with Muslim nations. Having actually done this, I can tell you: Insulting allies and partners is not a good way to start.

Another thing we know that does not work—based on lots of empirical evidence—is torture.

Many intelligence, military and law enforcement experts have attested to this fact. It also puts our own troops—and, increasingly, our own civilians—at greater risk.

I’m proud to have been a part of the administration that banned torture, after too many years in which we had lost our way.

And if I’m president, the United States will not condone or practice torture anywhere in the world.

Even when we’re up against opponents who don’t respect human life or human rights, torture is not the right choice. As Senator John McCain has said: The high standard to which we hold ourselves “isn’t about our enemies; it’s about us. It’s about who we were, who we are and who we aspire to be.”

America is a great nation. And this is a time for American leadership. Smart, strong, steady leadership.

No other country can rally allies and partners to defeat ISIS and win the generational struggle against radical jihadist terrorism. Only the United States can mobilize common action on a global scale in defense of our people and our values.

America doesn’t cower in fear or hide behind walls. We lead—and we succeed.

Throughout our history, we have stared into the face of evil and refused to blink—whether it was fascism, the Cold War, or hunting down Osama bin Laden. And we will defeat ISIS, too. No enemy or adversary should ever underestimate the determination of the American people.

I will never forget what it was like to arrive in Brussels for the first time as secretary of state, in March of 2009.

I was on my way to NATO. NATO headquarters was buzzing. Hundreds of young people at the European Parliament had stood and cheered—not for me, but for the idea of American leadership; for the promise of an alliance that delivered unprecedented peace and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic.

That’s what we need to remember today. Americans cannot—and I believe will not—turn on each other, turn on our allies, or turn away from our principles.

We’re in it for the long haul. And that means we’re going to work together. And we’re going to prevail.

This may be another one of the long struggles we have confronted from time to time in our history, but—like all the rest of those—if we can forge a bipartisan consensus, if we can bring our people to understand what this struggle means to us, if we can maintain our alliances and our partnerships, we will be successful.

And that will benefit not only our country, but the world.

And that, when you boil it down, is what American leadership has to be about.

by Brady E. Hamilton, Ph.D.; Joyce A. Martin, M.P.H.; and Stephanie J. Ventura, M.A. Division of Vital Statistics

This report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) summarizes 2005 preliminary births and birth rates and selected 2005 preliminary maternal and infant health birth data for the United States. The findings come from a substantial portion of the records of births (99.2 percent) that occurred in calendar year 2005 and were received and processed by NCHS as of May 31, 2006. A report that includes both these demographic and health characteristics of births as well as state-based preliminary 2005 data is in preparation ( 1 ).

Results from Preliminary Birth Data, 2005

Births and birth rates

Key findings, illustrated in Tables 1-3, 5-8 , and Figures 1-3 , show:

The number of births and the general fertility rate (GFR) increased slightly, whereas the crude birth rate remained unchanged from 2004 to 2005. The preliminary estimate of births in 2005, 4,140,419, increased 1 percent from 2004 ( Tables 1 , 5 , 6 , and 8 ) ( 2 ). Births rose for Hispanic, American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN), Asian or Pacific Islander (API), and non-Hispanic black women, but declined slightly for non-Hispanic white women. The crude birth rate in 2005 was 14.0 births per 1,000 total population, unchanged from 2004. The preliminary 2005 GFR (66.7 births per 1,000 women age 15-44 years), however, rose slightly from 2004, to the highest level since 1993 ( 2 ). The GFR rose for Hispanic and AIAN women, declined slightly for API women, and was essentially unchanged for non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black women.

The birth rate for teenagers declined 2 percent in 2005, falling to 40.4 births per 1,000 women aged 15-19 years, a 35-percent drop compared with the most recent peak in 1991 (61.8), and the lowest ever recorded in the 65 years for which a consistent series of rates is available ( Tables 2 , 5 , 7 , and Figures 1 and 2 ) ( 3 ).

The decline was concentrated among teenagers aged 15-17 years, for whom the birth rate fell 3 percent, to 21.4 births per 1,000, another record low for the Nation. The rate for this age group has dropped 45 percent since 1991 (38.6).

The rate for older teenagers, 18-19 years, essentially stable at 69.9 births per 1,000 according to preliminary data for 2005, was 26 percent lower than in 1991 (94.0). The birth rate for the youngest teenage group, 10-14 years, was unchanged in 2005, at 0.7 births per 1,000 females.

Among race and Hispanic origin subgroups, birth rates fell 3 percent each for non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black teenagers 15-19 years. The decline for young non-Hispanic black teenagers 15-17 years was 6 percent for 2004-2005 and 59 percent since 1991, the steepest reduction overall by race or age group.

Births to women in their early twenties increased slightly. The birth rate for women aged 20–24 years rose to 102.2 births per 1,000 women in 2005, less than 1 percent over the rate in 2004. The rate for women aged 25–29 years, the highest rate amongst the age groups, was essentially unchanged in 2005 (115.6) ( Tables 5 and 7 ).

Childbearing by women in their thirties and forties continued to increase. The birth rate for women aged 30–34 years rose slightly between 2004 and 2005, to 95.9 births per 1,000, the highest rate since 1964. The rate for women aged 35-39 years rose to 46.3 births per 1,000, 2 percent over the rate in 2004 and the highest rate since 1965 [ 2 , 3 ]. The birth rate for women 40–44 years also rose by 2 percent, to 9.1, the highest rate since 1968, and the rate for women aged 45–49 years increased slightly, to 0.6 births per 1,000 women, the first increase in the rate since 2000 and the highest rate for this age group since 1970 ( Tables 5 and 7 ).



Among race and Hispanic origin groups, the rates for women aged 30-34 years increased for Hispanic and non-Hispanic black women (about 2 percent each) and decreased for API women (about 2 percent). The rates for non-Hispanic white and AIAN women were essentially unchanged in 2005. Rates for women aged 35-39 years increased by 2 percent for women in each of the three largest groups (non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic blacks). The rates for the remaining groups were essentially unchanged.

The total fertility rate (TFR) rose slightly in 2005 to 2,054.0, compared with 2,045.5 in 2004 ( Table 1 ) ( 2 ). The TFR summarizes the potential impact of current fertility patterns on completed family size to estimate the average number of births that a hypothetical group of 1,000 women would have over their lifetimes. The total fertility rate by race and Hispanic origin increased significantly in 2005 for only Hispanic women (2 percent), and decreased significantly for only non-Hispanic white women (less than 1 percent) ( Table 1 ). Rates for non-Hispanic black, AIAN, and API women were essentially unchanged between 2004 and 2005.

The first birth rate for women aged 15-44 years was 26.5 births per 1,000, a slight increase over the rate in 2004 ( Table 7 ). The first birth rates for women aged 20-24 and 35-39 years increased between 2004 and 2005 by 2 and 1 percent, respectively, whereas rates for women aged 15-19, 25-29, and 30-34 years decreased by 1 to 2 percent. Rates for women 40 years of age and over were unchanged.

Crude birth rates (CBR) vary considerably among states ranging, in 2005, from 10.4 births per 1,000 total population in Vermont to 20.9 in Utah ( Table 8 ). There were generally only small changes in the birth rates for most states in 2005 compared with 2004; rates in 10 states declined significantly (Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Texas, and Utah) and rates in 7 states (Alabama, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Wyoming) increased significantly.



Fertility rates also vary considerably among states, ranging from 51.0 births per 1,000 women age 15-44 years in Vermont to 90.4 in Utah (see Table 8 ). General fertility rates for most states changed relatively little between 2004 and 2005, like the CBR, however, rates for 16 states increased significantly (Alabama, California, Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming), whereas rates for 3 states (Louisiana, New York, and Utah) decreased significantly.

All measures of childbearing by unmarried women increased to record levels for the Nation in 2005 according to preliminary data ( 2 , 4 ). The total number of births rose 4 percent to 1,525,345, compared with 1,470,189 in 2004. During 2002-2005, the number increased 12 percent overall.

The birth rate increased 3 percent in 2005 to 47.6 per 1,000 unmarried women aged 15-44 years, up from 46.1 in 2004.

The proportion of births to unmarried women increased in 2005 to 36.8 percent, compared with 35.8 percent in 2004. The proportions increased for all population subgroups by race and Hispanic origin ( Table 1 and Figure 3 ).

In 2005, well over four in five births to teenagers were nonmarital ( Table 3 ). Over one-half of births to women aged 20-24 years and nearly 3 in 10 births to women aged 25-29 years were to unmarried women.

Maternal and Infant Health Birth Characteristics

Key findings, illustrated in Table 4 and Figures 4 and 5 , show:

The preliminary rate of cesarean delivery rose 4 percent in 2005 to 30.2 percent of all births, another record high for the Nation ( Table 4 ). The cesarean rate declined somewhat during the early and mid-1990s, but has risen 46 percent since 1996 (from 20.7 percent). Rates were up in 2005 for non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, AIAN, API, and Hispanic women, and also for each 5-year age group. Since 1996, rates have risen by more than 40 percent for all age groups, including for young women under 20 years of age (see Figure 4 ). (For information on trends for 1989 to 2004 in primary cesarean deliveries and vaginal births after a previous cesarean, see “Births: Final Data for 2004” ( 2 ).)

The preterm birth rate rose from 12.5 to 12.7 percent for 2004-2005 (see Figure 5 ). The percentage of infants delivered at less than 37 completed weeks of gestation has risen 20 percent since 1990 (from 10.6 percent) ( 2 ). Preterm rates rose significantly for non-Hispanic white (11.7 percent for 2005), non-Hispanic black (18.4 percent) and Hispanic infants (12.1 percent) between 2004 and 2005. Rates for non-Hispanic white and Hispanic births have been rising for more than a decade, increasing 38 percent for non-Hispanic white, and 10 percent for Hispanic infants since 1990. The preterm rate for black infants declined modestly during the 1990s, but has been on the rise since the year 2000. Although the upswing in multiple births has had an important influence on recent trends in preterm birth rates, shorter gestations have also risen among singleton deliveries ( 2 ).

The proportion of all infants born very preterm (less than 32 completed weeks of gestation) rose very slightly between 2004 and 2005 (from 2.01 to 2.03 percent). Late preterm births (34-36 weeks) increased more markedly, from 8.9 to 9.1 percent for the same period. No significant change was observed in the percentage of 32-33 week births. Much of the upturn in the preterm rate over recent years can be attributed to increases in late preterm births ( 2 ), Figure 5 . Although at lower risk than those born at earlier gestational ages, infants delivered late preterm are at greater risk of compromised pregnancy outcome than those born later in pregnancy ( 5 , 6 ).

The percentage of infants born low birthweight also increased in 2005, to 8.2 percent of all births, from 8.1 percent in 2004 ( Table 4 ). The percentage of infants born low birthweight (less than 2,500 grams) has increased more than 20 percent since the mid-1980s (from 6.7) ( 2 ); the 2005 level is the highest level reported since 1968 ( 7 ). Low birthweight rates rose 1 to 2 percent for non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic infants between 2004 and 2005. Among all births, levels of both very low (less than 1,500 grams), and moderately low birthweight (1,500-2,499 grams) increased slightly for the current year.

Technical Notes

Nature and sources of data

Preliminary data for 2005 are based on a substantial proportion of births for that year (99.2 percent). The data for 2005 are based on a continuous receipt and processing of statistical records through May 31, 2006, by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS receives the data from the states’ vital registration systems through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program. In this report, U.S. totals include only events occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Detailed information on reporting completeness and imputation procedures may be found in the “Technical Appendix” of Vital Statistics of the United States, 2004, Natality (8).

To produce the preliminary estimates shown in this report, records in the file were weighted using independent control counts of all 2005 births by state of occurrence. Detailed information on weighting is available elsewhere (8). Detailed information on the reliability of estimates also may be found elsewhere (1).

The 1989 and 2003 U.S. Standard Certificates of Live Birth

This report includes selected 2005 data on items that are collected on both the 1989 Revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth (unrevised) and 2003 Revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth (revised). The 2003 revision is described in detail elsewhere (2,9-11). Twelve states and one U.S. territory (Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York State (excluding New York City), Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington) implemented the revised certificate as of January 1, 2005. One additional state, Vermont, implemented the revised birth certificate in 2005, but after January 1. These 13 states represent 30.8 percent of all 2005 births; the 12 states that implemented as of January 1, 2005, represent 30.6 percent of all births.

Hispanic origin and race

Hispanic origin

Race and Hispanic origin are reported separately on the birth certificate. Data shown by race (i.e., American Indian or Alaska Native and Asian or Pacific Islander) include persons of Hispanic or non-Hispanic origin, and data for Hispanic origin include persons of any race. Data shown for Hispanic persons include all persons of Hispanic origin of any race. Data are shown separately for non-Hispanic white women because there are substantial differences in childbearing patterns between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white women.

Single, multiple, and “bridged” race

The 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth allows the reporting of more than one race (multiple races) for each parent (9). Information on this change is presented in a recent report (2).

In 2005, multiple race was reported by Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York State (excluding New York City), Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont (for births occurring from July 1, 2005, only), and Washington, which used the 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth, as well as, California, Hawaii, Michigan (for births at selected facilities only), Ohio, Utah, and Minnesota, which used the 1989 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth. In addition, multiple race was also reported by Puerto Rico. Data from the vital records of the remaining 31 states, New York City, and the District of Columbia are based on the 1989 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth that follows the 1977 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standard, allowing only a single race to be reported (11-13).

In order to provide uniformity and comparability of the data during the transition period, before all or most of the data are available in the new multiple race format, it was necessary to “bridge” the responses of those who reported more than one race (multiple race) to one, single race (see “Population denominators”). Information on the processing and tabulation of data by race is presented in a recent report (2)

Marital status

National estimates of births to unmarried women are based on two methods of determining marital status. For 2004 and 2005, birth certificates in 48 states and the District of Columbia included a direct question about mother’s marital status; in two of these states, California and Nevada, a direct question is part of the electronic birth registration process but does not appear on certified or paper copies of the birth certificate. The question in most states is: “Mother married? (At birth, conception, or any time between) (Yes or no)”. Marital status is inferred in Michigan and New York. A birth is inferred as nonmarital if a paternity acknowledgment was filed or if the father’s name is missing from the birth certificate (listed in respective priority-of-use order).

Population denominators

Birth and fertility rates for 2005 shown in this report are based on population estimates based on the 2000 census, as of July 1, 2005. These population estimates are available on the NCHS Web- page (14). The production of these population estimates is described in detail in a recent report (2).

Information on the national estimates of births to unmarried women (i.e., methods of determining marital status) and the computation of the preliminary birth rates for unmarried women is presented elsewhere (1). The birth rate for unmarried women for 2005 is estimated on the basis of population distributions by marital status provided by the U.S. Census Bureau as of March 2005 applied to the national population estimates as of July 1 (4,14,15). Both population files are 2000 census based. The nonmarital birth rate shown here for 2005 thus differs from those published by NCHS in the annual final reports, which are based on populations estimated from 3-year averages of the marital status distributions, rather than a single year as shown here (4). Population estimates for a single year are not an adequate basis for computing age-specific birth rates for unmarried women—these rates are available only in reports based on final data.

Terrified teens ran past dead bodies and screamed in horror as they fled a Florida high school where a 'crazed' gunman killed 17 people in the latest US mass shooting.

Horrifying video captured by a student shows lifeless victims as teens were rescued by police and ushered out of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.

Students and staff barricaded themselves inside classrooms - with one group hiding in a closet as pupils cried in terror - as the shooter carried out the Valentine's Day massacre with an assault rifle despite previous warning signs.

In the aftermath, one traumatised survivor described how ""there was blood everywhere"" after bullets were fired through classroom windows as the gunman stalked the sprawling campus.

Teens posted disturbing photos and videos on social media, with one showing students hiding under desks and screaming as barrage of gunshots echo through the building.

The suspected gunman, Nikolas Cruz, was charged on Thursday with 17 counts of premeditated murder, with the victims including an assistant football coach who gave his life to protect students.

Today he appeared in court for the first time since the atrocity in Florida and will be remanded in custody.

Dressed in orange overalls, he bowed his head as the charge was read out to him.

A judge told him: ""I have something very important to tell you. You are charged with some very serious crimes.""

He was told he would be ""held without bond until further order"".

His lawyer Melissa McNeill said today after the hearing: ""He's a broken human being, he's a broken child.

""The sadness this community is feeling, I mean my children go to school in this community. I feel horrible for these families.

""And Mr Cruz feels that pain.""

All 17 families have been notified of the loss of their loved ones, police said in a briefing today.

The victims included students Jaime Guttenburg, Alaina Petty, 14, Martin Duque,14, Alyssa Al Hadeff, 15, Gina Montalto, 14, and Nick Dworet, 18.

Luke Hoyer, Carmen Schentrup, Meadow Pollack, 18, Joaquin Oliver, 17, Cara Loughran, Peter Wang, 15, and Alex Schachter were also killed.

Aaron Feis, 37, staff member Chris Hixon, 49, and science teacher Scott Beigel also were among the victims.

The FBI has now launched an ""extensive review"" into how the 2017 tip into Nikolas Cruz was handled.

It has also emerged that Cruz particpated in activities of white nationalist militia.

In a press briefing today, Broward County Sheriff said sadly there were copycat threats made at other schools today and they would be taking all of these seriously and would respond in full.

Officials in a press briefing today also revealed there were still bodies in the school.

Chief Scott Israel said today: ""There are some bodies that are still in the school.""

He said that ""today is the day of mourning"" after many lives were lost in the horrific incident.

On the investigation he said: ""We are not going to leave any stone unturned.

""We will interview every single student or person in that school who may know something.

""Law enforcement will do everything we can to make sure this person is convicted of all charges. We will make sure justice is served.""

Mr Israel later added: ""What about the rights of people who go to school with book bags - don't they have the right to be protected?""

He also called people in the community ""our eyes and ears"" and said ""right now, if you know anybody, this raises a red flag, don't just think about calling us, call us.

""If there's something in your gut that tells you there's something not right with this person, please say something.""

In the press briefing today, Governor Rick Scott said: ""We need to make sure this never happens again.""

He said: ""If somebody is mentally ill, they should not have access to a gun.""

Seventeen students and adults were killed and more than a dozen others were hospitalised in Wednesday afternoon's atrocity allegedly carried out by former student Cruz, described by ex-classmates as a ""troubled"" and depressed loner who was ""crazy about guns"" and had talked about shooting pupils.

Students had predicted Cruz would become a school shooter due to previous threats, his obsession with guns and knives and his unusual behaviour, it was claimed.

Police said the 19-year-old had previously been expelled from the school for disciplinary reasons, and returned with an AR-15 rifle - the same type of firearm used in many other massacres - plus a significant amount of ammunition and smoke bombs.

The gun was legally purchased, it was claimed as the motive for the attack - the ninth-deadliest mass shooting in modern US history - remained a mystery.

The atrocity began at about 2.30pm, with police claiming Cruz pulled the fire alarm and shot victims as they left classrooms before he blended in with pupils - pretending to be one of the terrified teens - and left the campus within about 25 minutes.

In the video showing terrified students fleeing after shots had already been fired, pupils scream and cry in a classroom where police crouch over a body on the floor.

An injured girl is carried out of the room by police and her classmates follow behind her and the officers after someone says ""let's go, come on"".

There are loud screams as students - including an injured boy grimacing and clutching his shoulder - pass bodies in a corridor and they are urged to ""run"" to safety.

Student Geovanni Vilsant, 15, told the Miami Herald that he heard gunfire when he was in a Spanish classroom and then saw three bodies on the floor as he fled the school.

He added: “There was blood everywhere. They weren't moving.""

A female student told Fox News of the distressing things she saw as police escorted her out.

She said: ""The police came through the hallway to get us and in the hallway, I saw a big pile of blood, like, kind of smeared as if they were dragged away, and I saw two girls probably dead in the hallway.

""And then, coming down the stairs, there was some more blood and outside the building there was another guy – I think it was a teacher – who was, [I’m] pretty sure was dead.""

Student Rebecca Bogart, who was in Holocaust class, told the newspaper that bullets shattered a classroom window and teens ducked for cover.

Rebecca, 17, said she got onto the floor and hid under a teacher's desk.

She added: “Four kids in my class were hurt. There was blood everywhere. I’m so glad to be living right now.

""I knew what gunshots sounded like, but not that loud or extreme. It smelled smoky.”

Sarah Crescitelli hid in a theatre class bathroom and sent a text message to her parents reading: “If I don’t make it I love you and I appreciated everything you did for me.”

Cruz allegedly wore a gas mask and tossed smoke bombs into a corridor before pulling the fire alarm and shooting people as they ran through the haze.

There was confusion when the alarm went off, as students and staff had practiced a drill earlier in the day.

The gunman went through corridors all over the campus, shooting more victims before leaving and blending in with pupils as they fled, it was claimed.

The local school superintendent said it's believed Cruz took an Uber car to the campus.

Cruz was allegedly carrying the gun in a duffel bag and had brought extra clothing with him, it was reported.

Student Matthew Walker, 17, told ABC 17 that the suspect was known to show off guns and knives.

The student said: ""He was going class to class just shooting at random kids. Everything he posts (on social media) is about weapons. It's sick.""

Another student, Eddie Bonilla, told CBS Miami that other students ""knew it was going to be him""

The student said: ""A lot of people were saying it was going to be him.

""A lot of kids threw jokes around saying that he was going to be the one to shoot up the school.

""It turns out that everyone predicted it. That's crazy.""

The rampage began shortly before lessons were due to end for the day at the school in Broward County, about 45 miles north of Miami. Tales of heroism began to emerge in the hours that followed.

School football coach and security guard Aaron Feis, 37, was fatally injured when he threw himself in front of pupils to shield them from the killer's bullets.

The football team confirmed his death on Thursday, writing on Twitter: ""It is with Great sadness that our Football Family has learned about the death of Aaron Feis.

""He was our Assistant Football Coach and security guard. He selflessly shielded students from the shooter when he was shot.

""He died a hero and he will forever be in our hearts and memories.""

Language arts teacher Melissa Falkowski hid 19 of her students in a classroom closet as the gunman went through the school.

She climbed in after them and they hid from the suspect until it was safe to come out.

In the aftermath, Ms Falkowski hit out at the US government and society for failing to prevent the massacre.

She told CNN: ""This is the worst nightmare that could ever happen to you.""

She added: ""We’ve trained the kids what to do, and the frustration is that we did everything that we were supposed to do... and still have to have so many casualties.""

(Image: Facebook)

(Image: Facebook)

Profiles of the victims, including Mr Feis, were also starting to emerge on Thursday, as students from nearby schools returned to lessons under increased security.

Student Jaime Guttenberg, 17, was confirmed dead after her parents, Fred and Jennifer, were unable to contact her amid the chaos and launched a desperate bid to find her.

Mr Guttenberg posted on Facebok saying his son Jesse had escaped unharmed but added: ""We cannot reach Jaime.

""If anyone has a child who saw or spoke to Jaime please call me.""

The parents were later given the heartbreaking news that their daughter was among the dead.

Her cousin Marc Pollack posted a tribute on Facebook, writing: ""This is a picture of our sweet cousin Jaime who was senselessly and tragically killed today at Stoneman Douglas High School.

""My heart is broken from the loss of this awesome young girl and the pain that our entire family is enduring.""

(Image: Facebook) (Image: Facebook)

Terrified students ran out of the building, while others took refuge inside as bursts of gunfire rang out. Staff and students got on the floor in locked classrooms, with reports that the gunman shot through windows or doors.

Hannah Siren, 14, who was in maths class, told the Orlando Sentinel: ""The people next door to us must have not locked their door.They all got shot.""

Student Alexa Miednik said she briefly spoke to Cruz as she and others rushed outside after the fire alarm went off and gunshots were heard.

She said: ""As we were walking the whole class together, I actually was speaking to the suspect Nikolas Cruz, and as I was speaking to him he seemed very, I don’t know what the word I want to say is, but he was troubled in middle school.

""So, I kind of joked to him about it and said I’m surprised you weren’t the one who did it, and he just gave me a 'huh?'""

As the lockdown was lifted after the rampage, bewildered students and staff streamed out of the school with their hands in the air, passing heavily-armed and helmeted police officers wearing combat gear.

Twelve of the dead were killed inside the school, while two others were shot just outside. One more was gunned down on the street, and two other victims died in hospital.

The school, which has about 3,200 students, remained on lockdown for about 90 minutes before students were finally released and reunited with their distraught parents - who were anxiously waiting for updates - in emotional scenes.

Cruz - described by former classmates as a ""troubled"" loner who was obsessed with guns - was arrested just after 4pm by police in nearby Coral Springs. He was wearing wine-colored Reserve Officers' Training Corps polo shirt, black pants and black boots.

Police said Cruz, who worked at a local discount store and was attending a new school, was armed with an AR-15 rifle and had multiple magazines of ammunition when he was arrested without a struggle.

Brent Black, a former classmate, told ABC News that Cruz had previously threatened to go on a shooting spree at the school.

He said: ""About a year ago I saw him upset in the morning. And I was like, 'yo what’s wrong with you?'

""And he was like 'umm, don’t know.' And I was like 'what’s up with you?'

""He's like, 'I swear to God I'll shoot up this school'. And then I was like, 'watch what you’re saying around me', and then I just left him after that. He came up to me later on the day and apologised for what he said.""

Students told reporters that Cruz was familiar with the school's layout and had been involved in fire drills in the past, so he knew what to expect when the alarm went off.

(Image: REX/Shutterstock) (Image: Getty Images North America)

Attorney Jim Lewis told the South Florida Sun Sentinel that the AR-15 used in the mass shooting was legally bought by Cruz, who lived with a family friend following his mum Lynda 's death.

A source told CNN that Cruz had purchased the gun in the past year after passing a background check.

Cruz's adoptive mum died in November at age 68 from pneumonia, while his dad Roger died from a heart attack when he was a younger boy, it was reported.

The couple had reportedly adopted Cruz on the day he was born, along with his biological brother, Zachary.

Speaking on behalf of the family friend, Lewis said: “It was his gun. The family made him keep it in a locked gun cabinet in the house but he had a key.”

Lewis said the family let Cruz move in around Thanksgiving, gave him a room and urged him to attend adult education classes.

(Image: REX/Shutterstock)

The lawyer said Cruz was ""depressed"" following his mum's death, and the family who took him in ""didn’t see this coming"".

A relative told US media that Cruz had been diagnosed with autism.

Following his arrest, Cruz was questioned for hours by detectives before he was charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder. Officers searched a number of properties linked to the suspect, including the home where he was living with a family friend.

The FBI and Department of Homeland Security were assisting with the investigation.

Former classmates claim he had previously threatened to shoot up the school, he had talked about shooting animals and he was obsessed with guns.

They also said he had a bad school record and was expelled from Douglas High School after getting into a fight with his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend.

Broward County School District Superintendent Robert Runcie told reporters he did not know of any threats posed by Cruz to the school.

(Image: AFP)

But maths teacher Jim Gard told the Miami Herald that he believes the school had sent out an email warning teachers that Cruz should not be allowed on campus with a backpack.

He added: ""There were problems with him last year threatening students, and I guess he was asked to leave campus.""

Photos posted on Cruz's Instagram account showed him posing with guns and knives. Police have described the social media posts as “very, very disturbing"".

It also emerged that a YouTube user called 'Nikolas Cruz' had written chilling comments on videos just months ago.

One comment under a documentary about the 1966 Texas University massacre read ""I am going to what he did"" [sic].

(Image: YouTube)

Another YouTube user claims someone with the handle 'Nikolas Cruz' commented on one of his videos last year, writing: ""I want to be a professional school shooter.""

The FBI were alerted to that post in September and carried out an investigation, but it was unclear what, if anything, happened from there.

When Cruz was a freshman he was part of the US military-sponsored Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corp programme at the school.

In an interview with Reuters, Jillian Davis, 19, a recent graduate who was in the programme with Cruz, recalled his ""strange talking sometimes about knives and guns"", but said ""no one ever took him seriously"".

Chad Williams, 18, described Cruz as ""kind of an outcast"" who was ""crazy about guns"" and was known for unruly behavior at school, including a penchant for pulling false fire alarms.

Trevor Hart, who had been in a Spanish class with Cruz, told the Orlando Sentinel that the 19-year-old seemed ""a little off"" and had talked about shooting lizards, squirrels and frogs.

Former schoolmate Alex Azar told CBS Miami: ""He always seemed like the unstable type, the type who would do this sort of thing. He was always in the office. He was always in trouble, very unstable. He had that look to him, kind of sinister.""

Former neighbour Shelby Speno told how police were called to Cruz's home numerous times and he had been seen shooting at a fellow neighbour's chickens.

Another former neighbour, Janine Kartiganer, added: “He wore a hoodie and always had his head down. He looked depressed.”

Wednesday's shooting ranked as the ninth-deadliest mass shooting in modern US history and the second-deadliest act of gun violence ever on a US public school campus, behind the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012.

(Image: Getty Images)

In that incident, deranged gunman Adam Lanza, 20, killed 20 children aged six and seven and six adult staff members after killing his mum Nancy at their home in the town.

Lanza shot and killed himself as emergency services arrived at the scene.

The number of school shootings in the US has steadily increased in recent years, and the Parkland shooting is just the latest chapter in the longtime debate over preventative measures, including gun control.

There were fresh calls for the US government to do more to prevent similar tragedies.

US President Donald Trump didn't mention any potential preventative measures in his response to the attack.

He appeared to suggest that those who were aware of the warning signs didn't do enough to alert authorities beforehand.

He wrote on Twitter: ""So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!""

(Image: Photodisc)

In earlier tweets, he wrote: ""My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.

""Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott. We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting.""

Reports from the US indicated that local police had dealt with Cruz on several occasions, he had been kicked out of school and staff were warned about him, and the FBI had investigated the ""professional school shooter"" comment that appeared to be posted by him on YouTube.

As well, CNN reported that Cruz was able to purchase an assault rifle after passing a background check.

Joe Melita, former head of the Professional Standards & Special Investigative Unit at Broward County Public Schools, told Action News Jax that that several district security officials were aware of Cruz

He added: “They were familiar with who the young man was.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted: ""I am at a loss for what more to say. I grieve with the families in Parkland today. I grieve with the families across the country who have suffered loss due to gun violence. Congress has a moral obligation to take action and spare more families from this violence.""

Meanwhile there have been 18 school shootings in the US already this year, an average of one every 2.5 days. At this time last year there had been seven, US media reported.

According to Gun Violence Archive, there have been 30 mass shootings since January 1, or one every 1.5 days.

Wednesday's school shooting occurred about 20 months after mass killer Omar Mateen, 29, murdered 49 people at a gay nightclub, called Pulse, in Orlando Florida. His rampage ended when he was shot dead by police.

The June 2016 massacre was the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history until gunman Stephen Paddock, 64, killed 58 people at a country music festival in Las Vegas last October.

Paddock shot and killed himself before police stormed the Mandalay Bay hotel room he had used into a sniper's perch.",1

HEADLINES



On what needs to be focused on and done in the U.S. to prevent small scale terrorist attacks from occurring:



""..it's this foreign fighter piece that disturbs me greatly. Because we don't have a good handle intelligence-wise who was on the ground in Syria, and Iraq, and Yemen to identify them, to put them on no-fly lists so they can't get in the country.""



""I think Europe has to strengthen and tighten its travel restrictions. But we need to look at protecting this country. Because I see it as a real threat.""



""And I think there's been in this administration a tendency to not call it that [terrorism] and to sort of have a false narrative that everything's okay when in fact the threat, I believe, is not diminishing. It's getting greater in northern Africa and the Middle East. And as that threat becomes greater, so, too, is the threat to the United States.""





***FULL TRANSCRIPT BELOW***



BOB SCHIEFFER: And we turn now to the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee here in the United States, Congressman Mike McCaul of Texas. You just heard Mike Morell saying how, you know, the intelligence services in France, and that their budget's cut, and then cut, and cut some more. I understand that the Homeland Security budget is being cut, especially as far as the T.S.A., all the people who guard our airports. Is that so? And are you good with that?



REP. MIKE MCCAUL: Well, we plan to vote on Tuesday on a measure that would actually increase spending within the department.



BOB SCHIEFFER: But you're cutting T.S.A. funds, right?



REP. MIKE MCCAUL: My understanding is there are (UNINTEL) in many areas of the department. And I think that T.S.A. obviously who oversees travel is very important. Look, this is a threat that happened in Paris. It could happen anywhere. And I think we need to be focused on that threat. This is a different style attack in the sense that you had foreign fighters that went to Yemen to train in the art of warfare and then bring that war back home to where they lived in France.



That could happen here in the United States. We've had thousands of these Western travelers that have become foreign fighters in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen that pose a threat and a risk of returning to where they came from and to do the same thing that we saw in Paris.



In addition, you hear a lot about the homegrown and violent extremist, the lone wolf if you will. We've heard a lot about that and radicalizing over the internet. But it's this foreign fighter piece that disturbs me greatly. Because we don't have a good handle intelligence-wise who was on the ground in Syria, and Iraq, and Yemen to identify them, to put them on no-fly lists so they can't get in the country.



These individuals were actually on a no-fly list and still traveled to Yemen and back. We had the woman, the female terrorist, leave and go to Syria. But she's on a no-fly list. So I think Europe has to strengthen and tighten its travel restrictions. But we need to look at protecting this country. Because I see it as a real threat.



BOB SCHIEFFER: Well, what do we need to do that we're not doing here?



REP. MIKE MCCAUL: Again, I think a couple things. I think our no-fly lists are working, I think, well. But you don't know what you don't know. We need to identify who has gone over there, traveled over there to fight this fight. And then how do we keep them off of airplanes and restrict their travel?



Western Europe, again, is more lenient in their travel restrictions. And we have a visa waiver-free system where they can fly in the United States without even having a visa. We need to look at all sorts of things like that. But mainly, it's driven by intelligence. I'm launching an investigation on my committee to look at security and defense gaps that may exist as it pertains to foreign fighters. This is the most successful foreign fighter terrorist attack that we have seen to date.



BOB SCHIEFFER: Well, how much of a threat does Al Qaeda in Yemen pose now? Because we see now that they're taking credit for this attack. You heard Mike Morell say, ""When they say they take credit for it, it generally proves to be true.""



REP. MIKE MCCAUL: Well, let's remember, this is Awlaki who inspired a major (UNINTEL) at Fort Hood. These two brothers traveled to Yemen and trained under Awlaki in the art of warfare and took that back. So you mentioned the war on terror to General Holder. And I think there's been in this administration a tendency to not call it that and to sort of have a false narrative that everything's okay when in fact the threat, I believe, is not diminishing. It's getting greater in northern Africa and the Middle East. And as that threat becomes greater, so, too, is the threat to the United States. And that's what we have to be prepared for.



BOB SCHIEFFER: So you think these are more dangerous times than before?



REP. MIKE MCCAUL: I believe with small-scale attacks, like, the larger scale 9/11-style more difficult to pull off. A bigger cell we can detect. A small cell like this one, very difficult to detect, deter, and disrupt, which is really our goal. And I think we're going to see more and more of these taking place, whether it be foreign fighters going to the warfare and return or whether it be someone who's getting on the internet, as John Miller talked about, and this very sophisticated social media program, and then radicalizing over the internet.

politifact1251,"Rockefeller: An Opportunity We Cant Pass UpRockefeller: An Opportunity We Cant Pass Up

Earlier this month, the president outlined a clear vision for health care reform  a plan that will put families ahead of corporate profits, reduce skyrocketing health care costs and provide a strong pathway for more Americans to access meaningful and affordable care. With Congress back in session and back to work on health care reform, we must continue to build on the presidents vision and capitalize on this profound opportunity to fix a broken system and make life better for millions of Americans.

Today, it is an undeniable fact that millions of families carry the burden of failed health care policies and unmet promises. Too many feel as if they are walking a tightrope  just one serious illness threatens to throw them off balance and send them tumbling down.

Real protection for the American people means health coverage must be accountable  the insurance that you buy today must be there when you need it tomorrow. Too many families who have paid their premiums faithfully every month for years expecting to be covered suddenly find themselves stuck with devastatingly high bills when they get sick; their plans dont actually provide coverage when they need it. It makes you wonder what the purpose of that health insurance is in the first place, if it offers no protection against the ruin that they hoped to avoid.

As chairman of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Health Care, I believe we must continue to make tougher insurance regulation and greater transparency a top priority, and I will fight to protect families and businesses across the nation.

The Finance Committee has laid out its framework, but at this point it simply does not go far enough to protect Americans from devastating insurance practices or outright loss of coverage.

Many Americans  46 percent  get their health coverage through large employers in the self-insured market. Any new insurance market reforms, such as a prohibition on rescissions and benefit caps, should apply to this market as well. Otherwise, we will be doing very little to improve the coverage of a significant number of Americans.

In West Virginia, the example of a local garment company, Corbin Limited, is a sad reminder of the self-insured markets risks. When Corbin declared bankruptcy in April 2003, 444 former employees were left with $2 million in medical bills. With a self-funded plan, Corbin was subject only to the Department of Labors inadequate regulation and had no licensing requirements or solvency standards. When the company went under, its employees had no means of appeal.

Comprehensive health insurance reforms like prohibiting rescissions, eliminating pre-existing condition exclusions and protecting employees in case of bankruptcy must apply to all insurers and policies in every single market  including the self-insured.

In the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, we recently heard testimony by Wendell Potter, who worked in the insurance industry for more than 20 years. He explained very clearly the tactics insurance companies use to keep policyholders in the dark. He said they deceive consumers with incomprehensible explanations of their benefits, often leading people to simply ignore them or throw them away.

He also said that more and more consumers are falling victim to deceptive marketing practices  which essentially encourage them to buy policies with high costs and limited benefits.

Consumers cant make real choices because the insurance industry doesnt use standard terms or definitions. And consumers cant challenge insurance companies decisions because the companies dont explain the terms of coverage in clear, understandable language. When insurance companies fail to meet their obligations to these people, it literally becomes a matter of life and death.

Thats why since March, Ive been holding a series of hearings in the Commerce panel to get to the bottom of these misleading practices and demanding explanations from companies like CIGNA. And its why I wholeheartedly believe that holding insurance companies  including self-insured plans  accountable for their actions has to be at the heart of any true health care reform.

Insurance companies have seen their profits soar by more than 400 percent since 2001, while premiums for consumers have doubled. Right now, the insurance industry is profit-driven when it should be patient-driven.

Theyre unfairly raising prices, cutting people out of coverage for pre-existing conditions and, as one report I released through the committee revealed, systematically overcharging consumers who choose to see doctors outside of their networks.

To fight back, I have introduced the Consumers Health Care Act. In addition to creating a strong public insurance option that would put competitive pressure on insurance companies and help drive down costs, my legislation also creates Americas Health Insurance Trust  created for consumers and run by consumers.

The presidents speech marked the first time the public option has been clearly explained to the American people. He reopened the door to a serious discussion about a public insurance option  and the time to have that discussion is now.

Our goal is comprehensive reform and that takes work, long hours, some disagreement, a lot of coming together and a deep commitment to bringing families real solutions once and for all. I share the presidents confidence and resolve that we will succeed.

politifact15591,"Broward County Sheriff Fired For Lying About ParklandBroward County Sheriff Scott Israel has been fired for covering-up the truth about what happened during the Parkland shooting.

According to reports, following a criminal investigation by Florida Governor Rick Scott, Sheriff Israel will be replaced as early as next week.

From Big League Politics: Sheriff Israel is being removed from office for criminal issues, not malfeasance, following an investigation conducted by the office of Florida Governor Rick Scott. The source exclusively revealed to Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is also allegedly being investigated by the IRS.

The high-level police source within the Sheriff’s Office disclosed that over the last several months, four candidates have been interviewed to refill the position of Broward County Sheriff. One of the candidates who were interviewed is Emery Giany, a Republican Florida law enforcement official who is closely associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.

During the IG’s testimony last week, FBI director Christopher Wray was asked about the Parkland school shooting. When asked, Wray declined to answer any questions about the shooting and Sheriff Israel, citing that it was an active FBI investigation. Following the Parkland shooting, Governor Scott called for Director Wray to resign over the FBI’s failure to properly investigate Nikolas Cruz, 19, the school shooter whose plans to carry out a school shooting were reported to the FBI twice prior to the shooting on Valentine’s Day.

“We constantly promote ‘see something, say something,’ and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. ‘See something, say something’ is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI Director needs to resign,” Governor Scott said.

According to the source in the Broward Sheriffs office, Sheriff Israel’s removal revolves around a criminal matter that the FBI is aware of. Although his failures surrounding the Parkland shooting initially sparked the investigation, it isn’t the sole reason why he is being removed.

The high-level source who wished to remain anonymous told Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is already aware of the fact that he is being removed from office next week.

Sheriff Israel has been under heavy criticism for his handling of the of the Parkland school shooting, which left 17 people dead. Following the Valentine’s Day school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it was revealed that police officers under Sheriff Israel’s order were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting.

It is unclear why law enforcement officials law enforcement at the Broward County Sheriff’s office and FBI failed to properly investigate Cruz, but their massive failure has been directly attributed to the loss of 17 lives in Parkland, FL.

Since the Parkland shooting, a lot of unflattering information has come out regarding Sheriff Israel. Along with being a mouthpiece for Democratic politicians and gun control advocates, like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who he has been photographed with, Sheriff Israel and his department have recently made headlines for more controversy.

In May, it was revealed that Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and the Broward County Sheriff’s office were keeping quiet the fact that Sheriff Israel’s son, Brett, had allegedly assaulted a 14 year old student on campus in an act of bullying.

Shortly after the Parkland shooting, cell phone video filmed by Cruz himself revealed that he himself felt bullied, which lead him to carry out a massacre on February 14, 2018 in a targeted attack against his former classmates.

Most recently, Sheriff Israel received a massive amount of backlash after the Broward County Sheriff’s office tweeted a picture of a new custom made Broward sheriff’s car that read, “Our new #dodge #charger. Do you like the paint job?”

The tweet sparked outrage online from Republicans and Democrats alike who quipped that the Broward Sheriff’s office should use the funds to pay for better officer training, not new cars. Leaders on both sides of the aisle have called for Sheriff Israel to resign or be removed by the Governor for his extreme dereliction of duty and failure to prevent one of the worst schools shootings in US history.

During the Florida GOP Primary debate in Florida last week, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam and Rep. Ron DeSantis were asked about the Parkland school shooting. Both Putnam and DeSantis called for the removal of Scott Israel while asserting their support of the Second Amendment.

“I would have removed that sheriff from Broward County. He failed his citizens and he should have been removed,” DeSantis said.

“Sheriff Israel is under investigation and he needs to go,” Putnam said.

Governor Scott is expected to release a statement in the coming week when Sheriff Israel is removed from office. Scott is currently running for US Senate in Florida, and news of Sheriff Israel’s removal is sure to boost his approval rating in what is gearing up to be one of the most important Senate races in the country.

In the days following the Parkland shooting, Sheriff Scott Israel was confronted and asked about his support of and affiliation with the Democratic Party and why he chose to blame guns instead of holding his department and the FBI accountable. Unable to withstand tough questioning, Sheriff Israel became flustered and ended the interview after saying, “the only person accountable for this killing is the detestable, cowardly, murderer. He is solely responsible for this horrific act.” However, as the investigation into Parkland has shown, both Sheriff Israel and the FBI dropped the ball and are to blame for their failure to prevent the shooting despite receiving multiple warning signs.",1

politifact14756,"DNC’s Donna Brazile Dedicated Her Book to ‘Patriot’ Seth Rich, Whose Death Made Her Fear for Her Own LifeA new book by Donna Brazile, the former interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), has been making headlines for its controversial claims about the 2016 presidential election and the Hillary Clinton campaign. But the provocative points start even before the first chapter, as Brazile reportedly dedicated the book in part to Seth Rich, the DNC staffer whose murder launched a conspiracy theory.

Axios reported on Sunday that the book's dedication reads, “In loving memory of my father, Lionel Brazile Sr.; my beloved sister, Sheila Brazioutlanle; my fearless uncles Nat, Floyd, and Douglas; Harlem’s finest, my aunt Lucille; my friend and mentor, David Kaufmann; my DNC colleague and patriot, Seth Rich; and my beloved Pomeranian, Chip Joshua Marvin Brazile (Booty Wipes). I miss y’all.”

Rich, 27, was fatally shot in July 2016 while walking home late at night in Washington, D.C. The police believe the shooting was a robbery gone wrong. But Rich worked for the DNC, and WikiLeaks published thousands of emails from the committee two weeks after his death. That timeline provoked theories that Rich had given the materials to WikiLeaks and that his death was an attempt to stop him from doing so, or to punish him for it.

Media reports had characterized Rich as a low-level staffer, and his parents wrote in an opinion piece for The Washington Post in May, “Those who have suggested that Seth’s role as a data analyst at the DNC gave him access to a wide trove of emails are simply incorrect.”

SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty

Rich appears elsewhere in Brazile’s book, as the Post reported earlier in the weekend. She wrote that Rich’s murder haunted her and that she'd installed surveillance cameras at her home and would keep the blinds in her office window closed so she could not be seen by snipers, according to the Post.

Brazile talked about Rich on ABC News’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. She told the host about her critics: “They don’t know what it was like to be over the DNC during this hacking. They don’t know what it’s like to bury a child. I did: Seth Rich.”

Brazile had spoken publicly about Rich’s death before. In March, she said she was going to an Omaha, Nebraska, synagogue to speak about him. In May, she tweeted, “Seth Rich was a hard worker and proud to be an American. This desire to scar Seth’s legacy to his country and party is shameful.” About two months later, after Fox News published a since debunked story about the case, she tweeted, “Seth was a good soul and look at this shameful act.”

Through spokesman Brad Bauman, the Rich family said in a statement, “Since Seth was murdered, Donna Brazile has been a great friend to the Rich family and has been extremely supportive of the family’s efforts to find Seth’s killers.”

In the book, out Tuesday, Brazile also writes that she weighed the possibility of replacing Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee with former Vice President Joe Biden, according to the Post. She also reportedly wrote that Clinton’s campaign headquarters seemed “antiseptic, like a hospital,” and that she felt as though the Clinton campaign was treating her like a “slave.” In an excerpt that Politico published on November 2, she wrote about how the Clinton campaign worked out a fundraising agreement with the DNC and exercised control over the party long before Clinton became the nominee.

Former aides to the Clinton campaign have challenged Brazile’s claims. In a November 4 open letter, more than 100 former top aides wrote, “It is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidate’s health.”

Brazile was not available for comment through her publisher, Hachette Book Group, or through Georgetown University, where she is a faculty member. The publisher was unavailable to verify the reported wording of the book dedication.",1

politifact390,"The Democratic Debate in ClevelandThis is rightly a big issue in Ohio. And I have laid out my criticism, but in addition my plan, for actually fixing NAFTA. Again, I have received a lot of incoming criticism from Senator Obama. And the Cleveland Plain Dealer examined Senator Obama's attacks on me regarding NAFTA and said they were erroneous. So I would hope that, again, we can get to a debate about what the real issues are and where we stand because we do need to fix NAFTA. It is not working. It was, unfortunately, heavily disadvantaging many of our industries, particularly manufacturing. I have a record of standing up for that, of chairing the Manufacturing Caucus in the Senate, and I will take a tough position on these trade agreements.

MR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.

Before we turn the questioning over to Tim Russert, Senator Obama.

SEN. OBAMA: Well, I think that it is inaccurate for Senator Clinton to say that she's always opposed NAFTA. In her campaign for Senate, she said that NAFTA, on balance, had been good for New York and good for America. I disagree with that. I think that it did not have the labor standards and environmental standards that were required in order to not just be good for Wall Street but also be good for Main Street. And if you travel through Youngstown and you travel through communities in my home state of Illinois, you will see entire cities that have been devastated as a consequence of trade agreements that were not adequately structured to make sure that U.S. workers had a fair deal.

Now, I think that Senator Clinton has shifted positions on this and believes that we should have strong environmental standards and labor standards, and I think that's a good thing. But you know, when I first moved to Chicago in the early '80s and I saw steelworkers who had been laid off of their plants -- black, white, and Hispanic -- and I worked on the streets of Chicago to try to help them find jobs, I saw then that the net costs of many of these trade agreements, if they're not properly structured, can be devastating.

And as president of the United States, I intend to make certain that every agreement that we sign has the labor standards, the environmental standards and the safety standards that are going to protect not just workers, but also consumers. We can't have toys with lead paint in them that our children are playing with. We can't have medicines that are actually making people more sick instead of better because they're produced overseas. We have to stop providing tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States of America.

And if we do those things, then I believe that we can actually get Ohio back on the path of growth and jobs and prosperity. If we don't, then we're going to continue to see the kind of deterioration that we've seen economically here in this state.

MR. RUSSERT: I want to ask you both about NAFTA because the record, I think, is clear. And I want to -- Senator Clinton. Senator Obama said that you did say in 2004 that on balance NAFTA has been good for New York and America. You did say that. When President Clinton signed this bill -- and this was after he negotiated two new side agreements, for labor and environment -- President Clinton said it would be a force for economic growth and social progress. You said in '96 it was proving its worth as free and fair trade. You said that -- in 2000 -- it was a good idea that took political courage. So your record is pretty clear.

Based on that, and which you're now expressing your discomfort with it, in the debate that Al Gore had with Ross Perot, Al Gore said the following: ""If you don't like NAFTA and what it's done, we can get out of it in six months.",0

politifact13283,"Warren Buffett says the super-rich pay lower tax rates than othersIt's not often you see someone stand up and say, ""Tax me more!""

Yet that's just what famed investor Warren Buffett has done in an op-ed in the New York Times headlined, ""Stop Coddling the Super-Rich."" Buffett says that very wealthy people like himself pay lower tax rates than the middle class, thanks to special tax categories for investment income.

""While the poor and middle class fight for us in Afghanistan, and while most Americans struggle to make ends meet, we mega-rich continue to get our extraordinary tax breaks,"" he writes.

As an example, Buffett said he paid an effective tax rate of 17.4 percent, while people who worked in his office made much less but paid higher effective tax rates of between 33 percent and 41 percent, averaging 36 percent.



""If you make money with money, as some of my super-rich friends do, your percentage may be a bit lower than mine. But if you earn money from a job, your percentage will surely exceed mine — most likely by a lot,"" Buffett wrote. ""To understand why, you need to examine the sources of government revenue. Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It’s a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""



Buffett's op-ed inspired a reader to write to us and ask how Buffett's numbers could be correct. As our previous fact-checks have shown, about half of all Americans pay no federal income taxes because they are low income. And when you analyze who pays the bulk of federal income taxes, it's people with higher incomes. So we decided to fact-check Buffett's statement that ""the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. ... (The middle class) fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""

Before we get to the heart of the fact-check, it's best if we review a few basics of the tax code that Buffett's op-ed takes for granted. This review proves the point that the federal tax code is extremely complicated, so bear with us.



Income taxes. Federal income taxes are progressive, which means your income is taxed at higher rates as you make more money. Let's take a married couple filing jointly as an example. In 2011, after deductions and exemptions:

• the income between $0 and $17,000 is taxed at 10 percent;

• the income between $17,000 and $69,000 is taxed at 15 percent;

• the income between $69,000 and $139,350 is taxed at 25 percent;

• the income between $139,350 and $212,300 is taxed at 28 percent;

• the income between $212,300 and $379,150 is taxed at 33 percent;

• the income above $379,150 is taxed at 35 percent.

Keep in mind that even if you're in the top bracket of 35 percent, you don't pay that tax rate on all your income. You pay 10 percent on the first $17,000, 15 percent on the money between $17,000 and $69,000, and so on.

Payroll taxes. Payroll taxes are separate from income taxes. If you work for a company, your employer deducts the payroll taxes before you get your paycheck and sends the money on to the federal government. These taxes pay for Social Security and Medicare; it's listed as FICA on your pay stub. Typically, workers pay 6.2 percent of their first $106,800 in earnings for Social Security taxes, and they pay 1.45 percent on all their earnings for Medicare hospital coverage. The employer has to match those taxes, bringing total contributions on behalf of an individual to 12.4 percent for Social Security and 2.9 percent for Medicare. Last year, though, President Barack Obama and Congress knocked 2 percentage points off Social Security taxes for workers, as an economic stimulus measure. So this year, most of us are paying 4.2 percent while employers pay 6.2 percent. Oh, and if you're self-employed, you typically have to pay your share and the employer share for totals this year of 10.4 percent on earnings up to $106,800 and 2.9 percent on all income. Payroll taxes are not progressive -- the rates don't get higher the more you earn. In the case of the Social Security taxes, which disappear once your reach a certain level of earnings, the percentage actually gets smaller if your income is higher than the $106,800 cap.

Featured Fact-check Says Osama bin Laden endorsed Joe Biden

Head hurt yet? Ours, too.

Taxes on investments. Okay, now we're getting closer to Buffett's main point here, and that's taxes on investments. The tax rates on investments tend to be lower than taxes on regular income. If you make money buying and selling stocks or receiving dividends from stock ownership, those earnings are generally taxed at 15 percent, the rate for long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

Some hedge fund managers and other finance-sector executives get taxed at this rate on their earnings because their compensation is classified as ""carried interest"" and taxed as a capital gain. (The Wall Street Journal breaks down how carried interest works.) In fact, some economists believe that the lower rates for capital gains actually encourages tax dodges, because it motivates high earners to look for ways to classify normal income as capital gains. Defenders say the lower tax rate helps the economy because it rewards investors for risk-taking and entrepreneurship. They also argue that taxing dividends amounts to double taxation because corporations pay taxes on their income before investors are paid dividends. We won't settle the argument here, but there's no doubt that investors get lower tax rates on their income than workers.

Getting back to Buffett's op-ed, his claims rest on how these taxes interact with each other. The fact we're checking here is that ""the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes,"" while middle class taxpayers ""fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""

He's right that a billionaire whose income is mostly from investments is probably taxed at a lower rate than someone who has an ordinary job. Very little of this taxpayer's income is wage income, so payroll taxes don't take much of a bite. It seems likely that much of this hypothetical person's income would be taxed around the 15 percent rate. And, in fact, as Buffett says, statistics from the Internal Revenue Service show that the 400 wealthiest taxpayers pay tax rates of less than 20 percent.

On the other side of the equation, people who work for a living, especially those who make higher than average salaries, get taxed at higher rates. It gets a little complicated, given how the tax brackets work, but basically, people who make between $100,000 and $200,000 are paying around 20 percent in income taxes, and it goes up from there, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.

Buffett slightly glosses over the fact that if you're in the 25 percent tax bracket, your overall tax rate is less than 25 percent. And, the more money you make, the more income taxes you pay, while payroll taxes seem less and less significant as a percentage of income. We're dubious someone would pay as high as a 41 percent tax rate, as Buffett claims someone in his office now pays. (The top income tax rate is 35 percent, but payroll taxes as a share of income decline as income rises, which makes it difficult to get above 37.9 percent, according to the people we ran this by at the Tax Policy Center.) We contacted Buffett's offices as Berkshire Hathaway about this point but didn't hear back.

One final note: People who don't pay any income tax at all tend to have limited incomes, or they qualify for enough deductions -- think of child tax credits and mortgage interest -- that they have no income. When Buffett talks about people in the middle class who pay more taxes than he does, he's thinking of people who make much higher than average salaries.

So when it comes to Buffett's statement, there are two categories: the rich and the really rich. And the evidence tends to point to the conclusion that the really rich pay less in taxes as a percentage of income then their merely well-to-do counterparts -- if their income comes primarily from investments. Overall, we rate Buffett's statement True.",0

politifact4275,"Krugman calls Senate health care bill similar to law in MassachusettsThe recent Massachusetts Senate election captivated Americans far beyond the Bay State. In that contest, Republican Scott Brown picked up a seat formerly held by the late Democratic giant Edward Kennedy. Brown's upset victory was aided by a wave of frustration over how Congress and President Barack Obama have been handling health care reform legislation.



During the campaign, Brown said that if he was elected, he would become the 41st Republican senator, enabling the GOP to block the Democratic majority from reaching the 60-vote threshold required to pass key legislation, including a health care bill. The Senate has already passed a version of health care, but it needs to be reconciled with a different bill passed by the House and then signed by the president before it becomes law.



As it happened, Massachusetts passed its own health care reform plan in 2006, with the help of both Republican Gov. Mitt Romney and a heavily Democratic legislature. Brown, then serving in the state Senate, voted for the plan.



On the Jan. 31, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, host Barbara Walters asked Brown about his vote on the Massachusetts plan. ""Why isn't what's good for Massachusetts good for the whole country?"" she asked.



Brown responded, ""In Massachusetts, the free market, the free enterprise has taken control, and they're offering a wide range of plans. I've never ever said that people should not get health insurance. It's just a question of if we're going to take a one-size-fits-all government plan or we're going to do something where the individual states can tailor their plans as we've done.""



When Walters asked him, ""Do you think the whole plan should be scrapped?"" Brown said, ""Yes.""



""The whole plan?"" Walters continued.



""Yes,"" Brown said.



Later, during the show's round-table segment, liberal New York Times columnist Paul Krugman expressed disbelief at Brown's response.



""That was the most evasive answer,"" Krugman said. ""If you think this is a straightforward guy, that was an incredibly evasive answer on health care, because the Senate bill, which has now stalled, is identical to the Massachusetts health care plan -- the same thing. Only in the finest of fine print is there any difference. He voted for the Massachusetts plan. A majority of voters in Massachusetts who voted for him approve of the Massachusetts health care plan. Nonetheless, their plan is dead.""



We wanted to see whether the Massachusetts plan was indeed ""the same thing"" as the bill passed by the U.S. Senate. So we looked at the details of both plans and consulted with an ideologically diverse group of health policy experts.



The consensus among our experts was that Krugman is basically right on the overall structure, although some of the details differ. As Elizabeth A. McGlynn, associate director of RAND Health, put it, ""Same recipe, different amounts on the ingredients.""



Here are elements of the two plans that are broadly the same, along with some of the differences in details:



• Individual mandate to buy health insurance. Everyone in Massachusetts must purchase health insurance or else pay a penalty; the same goes for the Senate plan, though the penalty structures vary between the two.



• Employer responsibilities for offering health insurance. Companies with more than 10 employees in Massachusetts need to offer health insurance or else pay a penalty. The Senate bill sets the bar for companies at 50 employees, though technically the bill falls short of a mandate.



• Health insurance exchanges. Both the Massachusetts and U.S. Senate plans involve the use of voluntary ""exchanges"" that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase private-sector health insurance. These exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premium levels.



• Affordability subsidies. Under both plans, lower-income individuals and families can receive government subsidies to help them pay their health insurance premiums. In the Massachusetts plan, subsidies are allotted on a sliding scale up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Under the U.S. Senate plan, the sliding-scale subsidies go up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level.



• Expansion of Medicaid. The Massachusetts plan expands Medicaid to all children up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. The U.S. Senate plan also expands Medicaid, but in a different fashion, offering it to all individuals (not just children) up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level.



• Insurance market regulation. Both plans restructure the insurance market, in similar but slightly different ways. In Massachusetts, the reform bill merged the individual and small-group markets (that is, it merged the market serving individuals not covered by their employer's plan with the market serving smaller employers). The U.S. Senate bill placed new regulations on those two markets but kept them separate. In Massachusetts, dependents up to age 25 can be covered on their parents' plan, while the U.S. Senate bill allows such dependent coverage up to age 26. And young adults in Massachusetts from age 19 to 26 can purchase a special lower-cost, lower-benefit plan through the exchange; the U.S. Senate bill creates a category of lower-cost, lower-benefit plan in the exchange for those up to age 30 who cannot find affordable coverage.



• Limits on the ratio between the highest and lowest premiums. In Massachusetts, the highest premiums can generally only be twice as high as the lowest premiums. The only factors that can be used to vary premiums are age, tobacco use, geographic area, the nature of the employee's industry, an unusually low participation rate (for group plans) and participation in a wellness plan. The U.S. Senate bill allows premiums in the individual and small-group market and on the exchange to vary based only on age (limited to a 3-to-1 ratio), geographic area, family composition and tobacco use (limited to 1.5 -to-1 ratio). Wellness programs do not factor into ratings variations under the Senate bill, but the bill does provide other incentives for such plans.



The bills differ more noticeably in several other areas.



• Cost containment. Critics of the Massachusetts plan have taken it to task for its lack of cost-containment provisions. The U.S. Senate bill makes changes to Medicare that are intended to lower program costs, such as restructuring how payments are made to Medicare Advantage plans -- the HMO option under Medicare. Since Medicare is a federal program, the Massachusetts plan does not address this issue. The U.S. Senate bill also authorizes the Food and Drug Administration to approve generic versions of certain drugs. This, too, is a federal rather than a state responsibility.



• Financing. Both the Massachusetts plan and the Senate bill are financed in part by revenue generated from the individual and employer mandates. But the Massachusetts plan's financing is heavily dependent on leveraging federal matching funds, while the Senate bill, in addition to cost savings from Medicare, imposes taxes on drugmakers, device manufacturers, health insurers and indoor tanning services. It also taxes high-cost (""Cadillac"") health care plans. The Massachusetts plan does not do any of these things.



""The Senate probably has more cost containment,"" said John Holahan, a health expert at the Urban Institute who has studied the Massachusetts plan extensively. ""And the financing is different. But the structure is the same.""



So it seems that there's broad agreement that, despite some operational differences, the broad structure of the Massachusetts health care plan is quite similar to that in the U.S. Senate bill -- certainly more similar than either one is to, say, a single-payer health care plan or even to the current system. Krugman's comparison of the two plans is Mostly True.

politifact12104,"One in FourOne out of every four Pennsylvania households is affected by addiction. More than 2,400 Pennsylvanians died from overdoses last year, making it the leading cause of accidental death in our Commonwealth.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day. Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms. More than 4 million Americans abuse prescription drugs or painkillers; another 435,000 use heroin.

These facts are shocking, but they reflect the reality right here in our neighborhoods, in Reading, in Lancaster City, and across Pennsylvania. It is happening to Democrats and Republicans, to people of every race and religion. It happens to our friends, family members, and neighbors. We all know them. And we share their pain.

No one suffers alone. We don’t have the option to think of this as merely a private or personal issue. Every addict comes from a family, and has people who love them and suffer with them. It can be almost unbearable to watch someone you love endure the physical and mental effects of drug abuse. Every addiction hurts not only an addict, but an entire community.

All of us pay the price of addiction, too, because it keeps people from fulfilling their potential and contributing more fully to our society. Drug abuse contributes to unemployment, homelessness, and sex trafficking. It puts pressure on government programs and budgets.

Ninety percent of addicts who need treatment don’t get it. Our health care system is failing not only them, but it is failing all of us. Addiction is treatable. We need to treat it, and we need to educate our young people properly in order to prevent the spread of addiction.

At a time when political acrimony is reaching a record level, leaders in both parties are coming together to find solutions. At the state level, Governor Wolf has ordered every state police vehicle to carry naloxone, an anti-overdose drug that has already saved hundreds of lives.

Congress likewise is working on a bipartisan basis, with the support of the Obama Administration, to make the system work better.

This week, the Senate passed comprehensive legislation to address the addiction crisis. The bill was the result of bipartisan effort, and passed with bipartisan support from both of Pennsylvania’s Senators.

In November, Congress passed and the President signed into law a bipartisan bill, the Protecting Our Infants Act, to review federal programs to help the newborns of heroin and opiate addicts. Tragically, thousands of babies are exposed to and addicted to drugs like codeine, morphine, or heroin before they are even born. Doctors are able to take these babies through the withdrawal process, however. Our new law will require the federal government to develop a strategy to address any gaps in current research or programs.

In 2015, the Energy and Commerce Committee’s Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee held five hearings on the drug abuse crisis. In October, as Chairman of the Health Subcommittee, I chaired a two-part hearing at which we heard from experts like the Obama Administration’s drug czar Michael Botticelli and Dr. Kenneth Katz of the Lehigh Valley Health Network.

Their testimony was as chilling as it was informative. Director Botticelli testified that over the past decade, the number of people treated for overdoses each year, and the number of babies born with neo-natal abstinence syndrome have both tripled. Dr. Katz told us about a number of adolescents in Allentown whom he has seen hospitalized and even killed after trying a new synthetic strand of cannabis.

At the hearing, we discussed seven bipartisan proposals that would improve federal public health policies and help addicts get treatment. Each of these seven bills deals with a different aspect of the epidemic, because we need a comprehensive plan: not just adequate funding, but targeted funding; not just emergency response, but education and prevention.

These bills would make a number of changes to existing law. They would expand the number of physicians who can prescribe the drug buprenorphine to addicts, develop best practices and a national awareness campaign, ban certain synthetic drugs, help pregnant women who are addicted, and create a patient tracking pilot program.

We aren’t finished. Congress will continue to take action on behalf of the families and communities across Pennsylvania and across the country being shattered by this public health crisis. We will work until the system works.

His wife Leah Tutu told reporters that the couple were in Texas for holiday and had plans of greeting George H.W Bush who lost his wife few days ago.

According to Leah Tutu, Desmond Tutu was rushed to hospital in the wee hours of Saturday morning where he passed on. The cause of his death is not immediately known.

In August 2016, Tutu’s daughter Thandeka Tutu-Gxashe he was in the hospital for treatment of a recurring infection.

Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe may have described him as “evil”, but Archbishop Desmond Tutu remained a much-loved figure across the world – principally for his role in South Africa’s struggle against apartheid.

During the long years that Nelson Mandela was in prison, Archbishop Tutu spoke out against the regime – and won the Nobel peace prize in 1984 for his efforts.

He was chosen by President Mandela to chair South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission and investigate the crimes committed by all sides during the apartheid regime.

Before his demise, “the Arch” – as he was known – had remained irrepressible and influential both in his native South Africa and on the global political stage.

He was chairman of a group of former world leaders called The Elders, launched on Nelson Mandela’s 89th birthday in 2007 with the aim of tackling some of the world’s most pressing problems.

politifact779,"Budget of the United States Government, FY 2008THE NATION’S FISCAL OUTLOOK

The President’s 2008 Budget addresses the Nation’s near-term and long-term fiscal challenges through pro-growth economic policies and spending restraint. Three years ago, the President set a goal to cut the deficit in half by 2009 from its projected peak in 2004. The President’s fiscal approach succeeded, and the results—including two consecutive years of double-digit revenue growth—allowed the President to achieve that goal in 2006, three years ahead of schedule. The Administration’s fiscal strategy of pro-growth tax policy, restraint in discretionary spending, and reductions in the growth of entitlement spending, will further reduce the deficit and balance the budget by 2012. This steady improvement in the deficit outlook is welcome news. Yet despite this improvement in the near term, the Nation continues to face pressing long-term fiscal challenges arising from our key entitlement programs. The President has made clear that he wants to work with the Congress to address this longer-term problem of the unsustainable growth in entitlement spending.

THE NEAR-TERM FISCAL OUTLOOK

Since the beginning of his Administration, the President has pursued pro-growth economic policies to give all Americans the opportunity to share in the Nation’s prosperity. Strong economic growth is also essential to generating the revenue needed to reduce the deficit. The President has pursued spending restraint in the face of enormous challenges, from the significant costs arising from the September 11th terrorist attacks and the subsequent War on Terror, to the response and rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina.

The size of the deficit and the debt is best assessed in relation to the economy as a whole, as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In his 2005 Budget, the President set a goal to cut the deficit in half by 2009 from its projected peak in 2004. The President achieved his goal in 2006, three years ahead of schedule. The deficit fell from a projected 4.5 percent of GDP, or $521 billion, to 1.9 percent of GDP, or $248 billion. This deficit is below the 40-year historical average of 2.4 percent of GDP, and is smaller than the deficit as a percent of GDP in 18 of the previous 25 years.

The Budget reflects the projected full costs of the War on Terror for 2007 and 2008. It also includes an allowance for at least a portion of the anticipated costs for 2009; actual funding needs will be determined by conditions at that time. In addition, the Budget assumes the extension for one year of relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). Even with these added costs, the deficit is projected to decline in both dollar terms and as a share of the economy in 2007. By 2012, the Budget is projected to generate a surplus of $61 billion. The Budget projects these results while increasing funding for the Nation’s security, investing in education and supporting other key national priorities, including making permanent the President's tax relief.

The Nation’s fiscal outlook is reflected in both the annual budget deficit and the amount of Federal debt held by the public, which is debt issued to finance past and current deficit spending. Debt held by the public has ranged from 33 to 49 percent of GDP over the past 20 years, and has averaged 35 percent over the past 40 years. For 2006, debt held by the public declined from 37.4 percent to 37.0 percent of GDP. For 2012, debt held by the public is expected to be 32 percent, below the 40-year historical average, providing further evidence that the President’s pro-growth economic policies and spending restraint are working to improve the Nation’s fiscal outlook.

Strong Economy: Fueled by Pro-Growth Policies

The President’s pro-growth economic policies, beginning with his tax relief proposals, have promoted America's entrepreneurial spirit, rewarding the hard work and risk-taking of the Nation’s workers and entrepreneurs. The tax relief included reducing marginal individual income tax rates, doubling the child tax credit, reducing the marriage penalty, reducing capital gains and dividend tax rates, encouraging retirement savings, reducing the estate and gift tax, and increasing incentives for small business investment. On May 17, 2006, the President signed the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005, extending through 2010 capital gains and dividend tax rate relief and extending through 2009 a provision to encourage small business investment by raising the expensing limits for equipment purchases. On August 17, 2006, the President signed the Pension Protection Act of 2006, tightening the rules relating to defined-benefit plans and making permanent some of the President’s proposals to encourage retirement and education savings.

Note: Shaded areas indicate recessions.

Because of the positive economic impact his tax relief program has had in the short term, and would continue to have over the long term, the President’s policy is to make tax relief permanent rather than allowing it to expire as scheduled at the end of this decade. Since the President’s tax relief was fully implemented in 2003, the Nation’s economy has generated more than seven million jobs. This strong economic growth has been good for the Nation’s workers and the resulting revenue growth has been good for the Federal budget.

For 2006, tax receipts of $2.4 trillion were 11.8 percent greater than in 2005, and in 2005 receipts were 14.5 percent higher than in 2004. Each year constituted record receipts and together made for the highest two-year percentage growth in receipts in the past 25 years. The Budget conservatively projects future revenue growth that averages 5.4 percent over the next six years, about equal to the projected overall growth in the economy.

The tax proposals in the 2008 Budget promote continued economic growth and, consequently, continued growth in the Government’s tax receipts. The Budget proposes to make permanent tax relief that was enacted in 2001 and 2003. In addition, the Administration proposes to change the tax code to encourage savings for retirement, to make it easier for all Americans to afford health insurance, and to increase small business investment. Furthermore, the Administration proposes to simplify the tax code for families, close tax loopholes, and increase tax compliance.

In addition to tax relief, the President will continue to strengthen the economy by advancing basic research and development, promoting innovation and accountability in education, reducing the burden on business of Government paperwork and regulations, reducing costly and unnecessary litigation, and eliminating trade barriers and opening overseas markets to American products and services.

National Security Spending: Protecting the American People

Security spending includes spending for the Department of Defense, homeland security, and international diplomatic efforts. International affairs spending finances efforts to create a stable government in Iraq, rebuild the economy in Afghanistan, and enhance security by promoting democracy and building alliances around the world. Between 2001 and 2006, security spending increased 41 percent overall: 36 percent for defense, 38 percent for international affairs, and 209 percent for homeland security. These significant increases were necessary to protect the Nation’s homeland and pursue the War on Terror after September 11th.

In his 2008 Budget, the President includes a further 10.5 percent increase in base defense spending. This includes funding to maintain a high level of military readiness to support the Global War on Terror and to continue to transform the military to meet the challenges of the 21st Century. The Budget includes a 17.1-percent increase in spending for international affairs to support key allies in the Global War on Terror, promote democratic institutions and values, counter the spread of HIV/AIDS, and provide humanitarian assistance to those affected by continuing violence and instability. In addition, the Budget includes a 6.7-percent increase to defend the Nation’s homeland by funding nuclear detection capabilities, strengthening the country’s borders, developing high-tech screening capabilities, and maintaining close partnerships with State and local law enforcement officials.

Spending Restraint: Slowing Growth in Non-Security and Entitlement Spending

The near-term budget outlook has improved in large part because of the double-digit growth in tax receipts and also because of spending restraint. Due to the need for increased spending on defense and homeland security as part of the Global War on Terror and the automatic increases in spending for entitlement programs, outlays rose to $2.7 trillion in 2006, or 20.3 percent of GDP. Despite these spending pressures, spending remained below the 40-year historical average of 20.6 percent of GDP. This is largely because over the past two years, the Congress and the President have reduced the growth rate in non-security discretionary spending—which grew by more than 16 percent in the last year of the previous Administration—to below the rate of inflation. In addition, in February 2006, the Congress enacted and the President signed into law the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, generating nearly $40 billion in mandatory savings over five years.

The 2008 Budget achieves spending restraint by holding growth in non-security discretionary spending to one percent in 2008 and for the five-year period. The Budget reduces or eliminates 141 programs saving $12.0 billion, and slows spending growth through sensible reforms in entitlement and other mandatory programs, resulting in savings of $96 billion over five years, and growing to savings of $309 billion over 10 years. This total includes $66 billion in savings in Medicare and $6.8 billion in Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) over five years, as discussed below. The Budget also proposes to increase premiums paid to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) by corporations with defined-benefit pension plans, providing $5.5 billion over five years to put the PBGC on a path to solvency. And, the Budget proposes to increase user fees, saving $7 billion over five years, to capture more fully the costs to the Government of providing particular goods and services.

THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK

While the near-term outlook of smaller deficits and a surplus starting in 2012 is encouraging, the current structure of the Federal Government’s major entitlement programs will place a growing and unsustainable burden on the budget in the long-term. Currently, spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security is approximately eight percent of the Nation’s GDP. With the first of the baby boom generation becoming eligible for Social Security in 2008, Social Security spending will accelerate. Three years later, the problem will become more pronounced as these individuals become eligible for Medicare, under which program costs rise even faster due to health care inflation. By 2050, spending on these three entitlement programs is projected to be more than 15 percent of GDP, or more than twice as large as spending on all other programs combined, excluding interest on the public debt.

The mandatory savings proposals in the 2008 Budget will not solve the Government’s long-term fiscal challenges, but they are an important and meaningful step, producing a significant improvement over the long term. Under the President’s Budget policies, the deficit in 2050 is projected to be 4.7 percent of GDP. In contrast, if the Congress fails to adopt the President’s mandatory proposals and permits current law to remain in force, the deficit in 2050 is projected to be 7.5 percent of GDP. A more detailed analysis of the Government’s long-term fiscal outlook is provided in the Stewardship chapter of the Analytical Perspectives volume of the Budget.

Social Security: Promised Benefits Outpacing Resources

Social Security was designed as a pay-as-you-go, self-financing program whereby current workers pay taxes directly and indirectly, through their employers, to support the benefit payments for current retirees, disabled persons, and survivors (collectively, beneficiaries). Such a system can only be sustained if the number of workers and the taxes they pay align with the number of beneficiaries and the benefits they receive. In 1950, when there were 16 workers for every program beneficiary, the combined payroll tax rate was very low at 3 percent of taxable wages. Currently, there are 3.3 workers for every beneficiary and the tax rate is 12.4 percent. The ratio of workers to beneficiaries is expected to decline further as the first of the baby boom generation becomes eligible for Social Security in 2008, and will fall to 2.2 workers per beneficiary in 2030.

Even after the baby boom generation is fully retired, the ratio of workers to beneficiaries will continue to fall, reaching 1.9 in 2080 primarily because of the growing difference between projected life expectancy and the age at which seniors become eligible for Social Security benefits. The increase in longevity, coupled with the fact that Americans are spending fewer years in the workforce, means that Americans are spending a greater proportion of their lives in retirement than ever before. Since 1940, life expectancy at age 65 has increased by approximately 40 percent and is projected to increase by an additional 20 percent by 2080.

The growth in retirees resulting from the retirement of the baby boom generation and increases in life expectancy will create a large and rapidly growing mismatch between scheduled Social Security benefits and the resources available to the program under current law. Through 2016, Social Security is projected to collect more in cash receipts than it pays in benefits. Beginning in 2017, however, Social Security benefit payments are projected to exceed the cash income dedicated to the trust funds. From this point forward, the Federal Government must borrow, tax, or cut other spending to pay excess Social Security benefits. Receipts are projected to continue falling to 70 percent of promised benefits by 2080.

There are many ways to summarize the extent of the mismatch between expected Social Security receipts and benefits. One such summary is the discounted present value of all future scheduled benefits net of receipts, or unfunded obligations under Social Security. The concept is to compare scheduled benefits and receipts under current law into the indefinite future, and to recognize through discounting that a dollar tomorrow is worth less than a dollar today. Based on the 2006 Social Security Trustees’ Report, the unfunded obligation of Social Security totals $15.3 trillion over the indefinite future. To put this figure into perspective, this is about three times the amount of Federal debt currently held by the public.

The President is committed to strengthening Social Security through a bipartisan reform process in which participants are encouraged to bring different options for strengthening Social Security to the table. The President has identified three goals for reform: to strengthen permanently the safety net for future generations without raising payroll tax rates; to protect those who depend on Social Security the most; and to offer every American a chance to experience ownership through voluntary personal retirement accounts.

The 2008 Budget again reflects the President’s proposal to allow workers to use a portion of the Social Security payroll tax to fund voluntary personal retirement accounts. These accounts will permit Americans to have greater control over their retirement planning, giving them an opportunity to obtain a higher return on their payroll taxes than is possible in the current Social Security system. The result will be to shift Social Security from an entirely pay-as-you-go system of financing toward a system that is less dependent on current workers. Beginning in 2012, workers will be allowed to use up to four percent of their Social Security taxable earnings, up to a $1,300 annual limit, to fund their personal retirement accounts; the $1,300 cap will be increased by $100 each year through 2017.

As one component of reforms to make the system sustainable, the President has embraced the idea of indexing future benefits of the highest-wage workers to inflation while continuing to index the wages of lower-wage workers to wage growth. Over time, wages tend to rise faster than prices, and so “progressive indexing” provides a higher rate of indexing for lower-wage workers than for higher-wage workers. This proposal would help restore the solvency of Social Security, while protecting those who most depend on Social Security. Comprehensive Social Security reform including personal retirement accounts, changes in the indexation of wages, and other modest changes will ensure the sustainability of the program for future generations, and help slow the unsustainable growth in total entitlement spending.

Health Care: Reforms to Improve Quality and Reduce Cost

The Nation spends more than $2 trillion per year on health care, permitting Americans to live longer and healthier lives than at any time in the Nation’s history. The Federal Government is the Nation’s largest purchaser of health care, accounting for approximately one-third of U.S. health care spending. As a result, economic developments in the health care sector, including the high rate of growth in health care inflation that confronts individuals and companies, are becoming acute fiscal problems for individuals and businesses, and for the Federal Government. Despite an enormous investment and enormous gains in the quality of care overall, health care inflation, the extent of private health care insurance coverage, and gaps in the availability of high-quality care are problems the Nation continues to face.

The 2008 Budget proposes a number of reforms to improve the Nation’s health care system. The Administration is proposing a significant change in the tax treatment of health insurance purchases and expenditures for out-of-pocket health care costs. Under this proposal, all individuals and families who buy at least a catastrophic health plan will receive the same tax benefits, in the form of a flat $15,000 deduction. The Administration’s proposal will make health insurance more affordable for millions of American families and reduce the number of the uninsured. This policy will also eliminate the tax bias toward high-cost insurance, making health care purchasers more price conscious and thereby marshalling market forces more effectively to restrain health care inflation. The Administration continues to promote the use of health information technology to enhance the health care delivery system, including the availability of price and quality information to individuals. This would allow health care consumers to spend their health care dollars more wisely, and avoid unnecessary procedures and treatments.

The President has also asked the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work with the Congress and the States on an Affordable Choices Initiative to redirect existing resources in the health care system to help poor and hard-to-insure citizens afford private insurance. This initiative would help avoid costly and unnecessary emergency room visits and improve health care quality and efficiency.

Medicare: Slowing Cost Growth through Reforms

The single largest fiscal challenge we face is the unsustainable growth in the Medicare program. The Medicare Part A Hospital Insurance program receives designated payroll taxes from employees and their employers, which are deposited in the Medicare trust fund held by the Government. Medicare Part A is therefore similar to Social Security in that it is an inter-generational transfer program with current workers paying benefits for current beneficiaries. In contrast, under Medicare Part B, the Supplementary Medical Insurance program, and Part D, the new drug benefit, beneficiaries pay premiums to cover some of the costs and the balance is paid out of general revenues.

As in the case of Social Security, Medicare will face increased cost pressures over the next several decades as the baby boom generation becomes eligible for and receives Medicare benefits. But because of rising health care costs, Medicare is projected to have much higher cost-per-beneficiary growth than Social Security in the coming decades.

Medicare’s dedicated revenues from designated payroll taxes and from premium payments cover only 57 percent of current benefits. The remaining 43 percent is financed from general tax revenues. By 2030, the pressure from Medicare on general revenues will be substantially greater as dedicated revenues are projected to finance only 38 percent of total benefits, leaving 62 percent of program costs relying on general tax revenues. This projected rate of growth in Medicare benefits is not sustainable over time.

The 2006 Medicare Trustees’ report shows that future dedicated payroll taxes and premiums are sufficient to cover only a portion of Medicare’s projected costs. This results in an unfunded obligation (the gap between dedicated receipts and projected costs) of $71 trillion over the infinite horizon. This is more than four times as large as the gap between receipts and projected costs for Social Security and 14 times as large the total amount of Government debt that is held by the public. Within Medicare, the Hospital Insurance trust fund, which is mostly funded by the Medicare payroll tax, has unfunded obligations, or a gap between dedicated receipts and projected costs, of $28 trillion. Meeting these obligations would require tripling the Medicare payroll tax. If the Medicare payroll tax were used to pay for Medicare’s entire $71 trillion unfunded obligation, the Medicare payroll tax would have to be increased by 500 percent. This would be a huge tax increase on workers and companies that would cripple the Nation’s economy. The only realistic solution is to reduce program growth to a sustainable level.

In the long run, part of the solution to Medicare and Medicaid’s unsustainable growth must lie with slowing health care inflation. Recent trends in the overall health care market have already improved Medicare’s finances. Spending on the Medicare drug program has been lower than originally expected because of lower-than-projected growth in prescription drug inflation. Medicare drug program spending in 2006, the first year of the benefit, was $15 billion lower than initially estimated. In addition, the drug program spending for 2007 is projected to be $25 billion lower than initially estimated, and for 2007 through 2016 the spending is projected to be $189 billion lower. The slower growth in prescription drug prices has been good for beneficiaries as well. Beneficiary premiums for the drug benefit are lower than expected: an average of $22 per month in 2007 rather than $39 per month as initially estimated. Controlling health care inflation is critical to the success of reform, but other significant reforms are also needed.

With an unfunded obligation of $71 trillion, and annual increases in spending well above inflation and other domestic spending, there has been increasing focus on the need to address Medicare growth rates. The 2008 Budget proposes to restrain Medicare spending both in the near term and in the long term. These proposals save $66 billion over five years and reduce the present value of future net costs by an estimated $8 trillion over 75 years. These are sensible reforms, most of which have been proposed in previous budgets. The aggregate impact of the proposed reforms only slows the rate of growth of the Medicare program from 7.4 percent over 10 years to 6.7 percent.

To achieve these savings, the Budget proposes to promote high-quality and cost-efficient care through competition and innovation. Specifically, the Budget proposes to adjust permanently provider payments to encourage efficiency and productivity, taking advantage of advances in medical technology and the delivery of care, and other management improvements. The Budget also proposes to establish competitive bidding for clinical laboratory services.

The Budget also proposes to encourage greater responsibility for health care use and costs for high-income beneficiaries. In addition, the Budget proposes to modernize and rationalize Medicare policies to encourage efficient and cost-effective payments. For example, the Budget proposes to ensure that patients are served in the most medically appropriate and cost-efficient setting for post-acute care, and that payments for medical equipment be brought in line with actual costs.

In addition to proposing specific reforms to reduce the unsustainable rate of growth in the near term, the Budget also proposes a new mechanism to address the long-term funded unfunded obligation in Medicare. The Budget proposes to build on the progress made in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) with respect to Medicare financing. Under current law, MMA requires the Medicare Trustees issue a “funding warning” if, for two consecutive years, the Trustees find that more than 45 percent of projected Medicare expenditures will require funding from general tax revenue (rather than dedicated resources) within the next six years. In the 2006 Trustees’ Report, the Trustees found that general revenue funding would first reach the 45 percent level in 2012, within the seven-year window specified in the MMA.

The 2008 Budget proposes to add an incentive for reform to the MMA funding warning. Specifically, in the year in which the 45 percent threshold is exceeded, there would be automatic payment reductions to providers by four-tenths of one percent per year. The provider payments would continue to be reduced by an additional four-tenths of one percent per year, as long as Medicare’s receipts cover 55 percent or less of program costs. The provision is intended to encourage the Congress and the Administration to reach agreement on reforms needed to slow the growth in program costs.

Medicaid: Proposals Ensure Fiscal Integrity

Medicaid is the Federal entitlement program that provides medical assistance, including acute and long-term care, to low-income families with dependent children and to low-income individuals who are elderly, blind, or disabled. As with Medicare, Medicaid costs will increase substantially in the coming decades as the baby boomers retire and begin to have greater health care needs. An increasing number of low-income elderly individuals will come to rely on Medicaid for non-hospital care, including long-term care. In addition, as with Medicare, Medicaid will be under increasing fiscal pressure in the coming decades as a result of health care inflation.

The President’s Budget proposes a package of program integrity reforms. These reforms save approximately $6.8 billion over five years, including additional increased funding for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). The Budget builds on previous initiatives, some of which were included in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, to promote sound financial practices, increase market efficiencies, and eliminate Medicaid overpayments. The proposals included in the 2008 Budget help to ensure the fiscal integrity of Medicaid by lowering its rate of growth. These proposed changes reduce the rate of growth of Medicaid from 7.7 percent to 7.6 percent over the next 10 years.

BUDGET REFORMS

During the 1990s, budget decisions were governed by the now-expired Budget Enforcement Act (BEA). Under the BEA, discretionary spending (including both budget authority and actual outlays) was limited each fiscal year to a maximum amount specified in law. In addition, under the BEA, pay-as-you-go rules required all legislation involving new mandatory spending or tax cuts was required to be deficit neutral. Violations of the discretionary spending caps or the pay-as-you-go provisions triggered across-the-board spending reductions. The BEA generally succeeded in preventing the Government’s budgetary outlook from deteriorating.

Based in part on the spending controls in the BEA, the President has proposed a number of budget process reforms, including new caps on discretionary spending, a pay-as-you-go requirement for mandatory spending, a line-item veto, and earmark reform. In addition, the Administration implemented its own pay-as-you-go controls to limit mandatory spending resulting from agency administrative action. Specifically, on May 23, 2005, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) began requiring that proposed agency administrative action that increases mandatory spending be offset by administrative actions that reduce mandatory spending by the same amount.

Federal spending is generally divided into three major categories: discretionary spending (approximately 38 percent of the Budget), mandatory spending (53 percent), and interest on the debt (9 percent).

Discretionary Spending Caps: Restraining Annual Appropriations

Discretionary spending is generally thought of as funding the day-to-day operations of Government and is the only spending subject to annual review and appropriations by the Congress and the President. As distinct from mandatory spending, discretionary spending must be enacted into law every year before Government agencies may obligate and spend money. Hence, discretionary spending is not subject to the same automatic, uncontrolled growth characteristic of some mandatory spending. Nevertheless, without active restraint reinforced by effective rules governing the legislative process, discretionary spending will tend to increase steadily over time. The 2008 Budget proposes to reinstate BEA controls on discretionary spending. Specifically, the Budget proposes placing statutory limits or “caps” on discretionary spending each year through 2012. Any appropriations bill that causes the caps to be exceeded would be subject to a point of order, requiring a three-fifths vote, in the Senate. If, in the aggregate, appropriations actions exceed the spending caps, then OMB would be required to make across-the-board cuts to reduce total discretionary spending to the statutory caps.

Within these proposed spending caps, the Budget proposes to devote resources for program integrity efforts. Program integrity efforts are designed to eliminate spending to those not eligible for benefit payments and to collect unpaid taxes due to the Government. Since program integrity efforts can generate as high as a ten-to-one return to the Government, the Administration proposes an adjustment to the statutory discretionary spending limits for amounts dedicated to program integrity.

Mandatory Spending Controls: Restraining Automatic Spending

The vast majority of spending for mandatory programs takes place automatically every year without any action on the part of the Congress or the President. It is made up of “entitlement” programs, for which the amount of spending is based on the number of qualifying beneficiaries and benefit formulas specified in law. This spending provides income security and health care to individuals who are elderly, disabled, widowed, or orphaned. These programs are effectively exempt from the annual review and approval in the budget process because the benefit qualifications and benefit formulas are specified in law, resulting in an automatic appropriation of benefit payments.

In 1962, mandatory spending accounted for just over one-quarter of total Government outlays and discretionary spending accounted for slightly more than two-thirds of Government outlays; the remainder of outlays was for interest. Today, the picture is dramatically different, with mandatory spending having doubled as a share of total outlays, now accounting for 53 percent of all Government spending. Without intervention, entitlement spending over the next four decades will become unsustainable. With the baby boom population beginning to become eligible for Social Security in 2008 and Medicare in 2011, the time to address this problem is now.

The 2008 Budget proposes to place limits on new mandatory spending. In addition to the proposal to address excessive general revenue spending in Medicare, discussed above, the Budget also proposes a pay-as-you-go requirement such that any legislation that increases mandatory spending be offset by reductions in other mandatory spending. Any legislation that increases mandatory spending without an equal offset wou",0

Obama is a shadow president that will not leave the current administration alone. He has been doing everything he can to mess up what Trump is doing. And being a liberal elite, he can get away with it. Everywhere President Donald Trump goes, Obama shows up too. A little odd, no? This concerning practice has gotten on the last nerve of the Trump administration and it shows that they are concerned with what Obama is trying to do. Obama needs to realize that he is no longer the president, no matter how much he wants to be.

Obama first went to Italy when Trump was there to try to disrupt what was going on there. Does he not know when to give up? It seems like now is as good a time as any. Obama’s administration is currently under investigation for many criminal actions they did while in office. Maybe he wants to try to deflect all of the negative press about him to Trump, like he so often does. But this last on was truly an Obama move.

The liberal media has been attacking the Trump administration for the hotel accommodations snafu that caused them to be without a hotel for awhile. But as it turns out, that was actually the Obama administration’s problem, not Trumps. So he is getting blamed for something that is clearly not his fault yet again. That is what conservatives have gotten used to over the years. Apparently liberals can do no wrong. When will the mainstream media report on that?

“The funny thing,” a White House official said, “is that the United States delegation probably also would not have had hotel rooms if Hillary Clinton had become president. It was already too late by Election Day.”

“But I bet even if Hillary had to sleep in a youth hostel,” he went on, “no one in the press would say it was her staffs’ fault.”

That is the double standard that we have to live with as Americans and it will not get any better. What do you think about this whole mess?

politifact1255,"Oct. 11: Levin, Graham, McCaffrey, Myers, roundtableOct. 11: The debate over the best way forward intensifies in Washington. Two key voices on the Hill and two experienced military leaders weigh in on the direction a new war strategy should take: Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI); Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC); Gen. Barry McCaffrey (Ret.); and Gen. Richard Myers (Ret.). Plus a roundtable: Ron Brownstein, Paul Gigot, Katty Kay, Bob Woodward.

GREGORY: Realistically, from both of you generals, what is victory in Afghanistan?

GEN. MYERS: Some sort--in my view, it's some sort of stable government. And back to Senator Levin's point...

GREGORY: So we can't leave. We can't pull troops out of Afghanistan until there's a stable government?

GEN. MYERS: I think it has to be a viable, stable government that the people believe in. And if you're going to have Afghan security forces that are effective, they have to be connected to the central government and feel that there's some connection and some direction coming from their central government. Otherwise it doesn't work; they're just in the field doing what they do but there's no connection to the overall mission of that country. So I think clearly that's, that's part of it. And I think there has to be some economic development to give people there hope that there's something beyond...

GREGORY: Yeah.

GEN. MYERS: ...what they're doing today.

GREGORY: Can we beat the Taliban?

GEN. McCAFFREY: Well, I, I think in 10 years of $5 billion a month and with a significant front-end security component, we can leave a Afghan national army and police force and a viable government and roads and universities. But it's a time constraint that we can't change things in 18 to 24 months. So I think we got to lower expectations. Senator Levin talked about our political resolve; is it there or not? You know, sort of a simplistic lesson I learned as an infantry company commander in combat, you only got three choices. When you're under fire you can hunker down and take casualties--it's bad--you can break contact and withdraw or you can reinforce and attack. That's really the, the challenge facing the Obama administration right now. And the, the politics of it are really tough. The American people do not appear to support large-scale continued intervention in this conflict.

GREGORY: Just with, with very little time left, I want to get to two other issues. The president spoke last night at the Human Rights Campaign dinner and spoke about ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell.""

(Videotape)

PRES. OBAMA: I'm working with the Pentagon, its leadership and the members of the House and Senate on ending this policy. Legislation has been introduced in the House to make this happen. I will end ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell."" That's my commitment to you.

(End videotape)

GREGORY: That, of course, the position of the military to expel gays and lesbians from service.

Senator Levin, will the president live up to this pledge? Can he?

SEN. LEVIN: I think he, he will and he can. I think it has to be done in the, in the right way, which is to get a buy-in from the military, which I think is now possible. Other militaries in the West, the British and other Western armies, have ended this discriminatory policy. We can do it successfully. But it ought to be done with thoughtfulness and with care, and with a buy-in from the military.

GREGORY: General Myers, is it time?

GEN. MYERS: I can't talk about whether it's time or not. I think the process that Senator Levin outlined is exactly right, that the senior military leadership needs to be part of this.

GREGORY: Mm-hmm.

GEN. MYERS: The Pentagon needs to be part of it.

GREGORY: Do you have an opinion about whether it's time?

GEN. MYERS: Well, I, I take some exception to what Senator Levin said, because gays can serve in the military, just can't serve openly. And they, they do and there's lot of them. And we are, and we are, and we're the beneficiary of all that.

GREGORY: OK.

GEN. MYERS: So I'll leave it to the current folks to, to decide whether it's time or not.

GEN. McCAFFREY: Well, there's no question it's time to change the policy. The key to it isn't buy-in from the military, it's for Congress to change the law. They ought to do so. And we would--I'm confident the military will move ahead on it.

SEN. LEVIN: And we, I think, will do that, but we'll need the support at least of some of the military to do it.

GEN. MYERS: I think that's right. You can't...

GREGORY: Does the, does the president have the political resolve to make good on his promise?

SEN. LEVIN: Oh, he does, and I think many of us do.

GREGORY: Yeah.

SEN. LEVIN: I thought it was a mistake to begin with.

GREGORY: Right. Congress has the resolve as well to change it?

SEN. LEVIN: I think we will gain that resolve. The way we've made other changes in this country, the military are the ones that ended a discriminatory policy against African-Americans. They can end it here and it will be great progress.

GREGORY: And finally, Senator Graham, on that question, do you think the military should end the policy?

SEN. GRAHAM: Well, it's my belief that if the policy--you don't have buy-in by the military, that's a disservice to the people in the military. They should be included in this. I'm open-minded to what the military may suggest. But I can tell you, I'm not going to make policy based on a campaign rally.

And when it comes to time, the one thing I would say again about Afghanistan, history will judge not when we left but by what we left behind. And our national security interests will be determined by what we left behind and not when we left. And if this policy about ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" changes, it should be done based not on politics, but on reason.

GREGORY: And, and, finally, Senator Graham, do you think the president deserved the Nobel Peace Prize?

SEN. GRAHAM: If he can successfully turn around Afghanistan, deter Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, I will build a bookcase for him to put it in. It depends on what he does.

GREGORY: Senator Levin?

SEN. LEVIN: I think it was a, a positive statement about hope for America, as well as a recognition of the new direction that he's setting for us.

GREGORY: All right, we are going to leave it there. This debate will continue. Thanks to all of you.

(Announcements)

GREGORY: We are back and joined now by BBC America's Katty Kay, The Washington Post's Bob Woodward, National Journal's Ron Brownstein and Paul Gigot of The Wall Street Journal.

Welcome to all of you. So much to get to this week; war and peace, as I said at the outset. But let's talk about the politics of war, and I think it's striking. Here we are in October of 2009, and it was October of 2001 when President Bush made the decision to go to war. In October of 2009, another president has to make another big decision about troops in Afghanistan, and look how the politics have changed. This was a USA Today/Gallup poll about views of sending more troops, and what you see here is a huge political divide: Democrats, 36 percent for it; Republicans, 73 percent for it. Opponents on the Democratic side, 59 percent to 23 percent.

Bob Woodward, what's different? What are the politics here for this president?

MR. BOB WOODWARD: Well, I, I think what's interesting, instead of trying to figure out the future, what's going on in the White House now? It's extraordinary series of very long meetings. One of the big criticisms of Lyndon Johnson during Vietnam was he wouldn't listen, and Obama is listening. He's on a listening tour, and everyone is getting their say. And he's got to, he's got to make a giant decision not about troop numbers, but what's the strategy? And I think, you know, this is, this is the test for him. Can he come up with some consensus so the military doesn't feel wounded, so his own party doesn't feel wounded? And if he does that, you know, a lot of people, even if they don't agree with the final decision, will say he did something--again, George W. Bush, in deciding to go into Iraq, the model there was he decided...

GREGORY: Right.

MR. WOODWARD: ...""We're going to do it."" All the meetings were about how to do it, never considering other options.

GREGORY: But, but there, there is a real debate about this policy that has broken into the public, and you broke this story with McChrystal's assessment. The vice president is on the cover of Newsweek magazine with his perspective as a, as a counselor to the president on important matters, including this question of Afghanistan. This is played out--we spent a lot of time talking about this in the Bush administration over Iraq. This has really played out publicly.

MR. WOODWARD: But, but--and I think to everyone's benefit, including the president's, including the military and certainly the, the public. Look, if we had had the secret report on WMD in Iraq before the war and published that, history might have been different. It's very important to know, if you can, what these classified memos say. And in the, in this case we have it, and people are talking about something very concrete.

GREGORY: Paul Gigot, the, the question is the president had a strategy. He announced it in March.

MR. PAUL GIGOT: I thought--yeah.

GREGORY: It was clear. This is what Charles Krauthammer wrote on Friday in his column: ""So what does [the] commander-in-chief do now with the war he once declared had to be won but had been almost criminally underresourced by Bush? Perhaps provide the resources to win it? You would think so. ... Obama agonizes publicly and the world watches. Why?""",0

If Republicans capture control of the U.S. Senate, there will be many explanations for their victory: President Obama’s poor numbers, a great Senate map filled with attractive opportunities, a generally strong slate of candidates, the success of establishment-backed Republicans in primaries and others.

But one of the biggest factors will have hardly anything to do with the national political climate or, really, the campaign as a whole. Five Democrats, all of whom are old enough to be eligible for Medicare, decided not to run for another term in the Senate. Their decisions, all announced before May 2013, are a huge but largely forgotten boon to GOP hopes.

Advertisement

The five retirements were: Max Baucus of Montana, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Carl Levin of Michigan and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia. (A sixth, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, had announced his retirement, but he later died: Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat, now holds the seat after a special election last year.)

Retirements present a challenge for the incumbent party because it’s easier for a party to hold a Senate seat when an incumbent runs for reelection. Significantly easier.

Over the past half-century, about 85 percent of incumbent senators running in the general election were reelected. In open seats, during the same time period, the incumbent party held the seat just about 60 percent of the time. So not having an incumbent in a Senate race substantially reduces the odds of victory.

The importance of open seats to GOP Senate hopes is particularly pronounced because of the party’s recent inability to defeat Democratic incumbents.

In 1980, Republicans beat an eye-popping nine Democratic incumbents on Election Day to capture control of the Senate for the first time in a quarter-century. Since then, the GOP has not defeated more than two Democratic Senate incumbents in any general election. The party’s best recent Senate years, 1994 and 2010, were built largely on winning open seats (six in 1994, and four in 2010). Democrats, meanwhile, have had more success: They beat seven and six incumbent Republicans, respectively, in recapturing the upper chamber in 1986 and 2006. The latter year, 2006, was notable in that Democrats did not capture a single open seat in netting the six seats they needed to eke out a narrow 51-49 Senate edge.

Republicans seem likely to beat more than two Democratic Senate incumbents this November for the first time in almost 35 years: Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas all have less than 50-50 odds of winning, according to the University of Virginia Center for Politics’ Crystal Ball ratings, which I help formulate. Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado is right at 50-50, and Sens. Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire are both in tough races too.

But in all likelihood, the foundation for this year’s GOP gains will be built on winning open seats. That’s why the Democratic exits loom so large in the upcoming election.

An election where these five senators chose to run for another term would look significantly different: There would probably be more competitive races, and Democrats would have a greater number of redoubts to hold off the Republican advance.

Let’s assume, for the purposes of this “what if” exercise, that all five retirees were healthy enough and eager enough to have run for reelection, which is of course a big assumption for a group whose average age is 74 years old:

West Virginia: Rockefeller might still be an underdog to Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (R), who entered the race before the incumbent retired. But that race would have been much closer, presumably, than Capito’s largely sleepy contest against West Virginia Secretary of State Natalie Tennant, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee would not have been able to just take a pass on the race, as it has this cycle. Capito’s strong performance as a candidate is an often overlooked bright spot for Republicans this cycle – she’s done so well, in a state where the GOP hasn’t won a Senate seat in more than a half century, that the race never became obviously competitive – but running in an open seat has made her job easier. The Crystal Ball rating here is Safe Republican; with Rockefeller in the race, we’d probably rate it just Leans Republican or maybe Toss-up. A few polls before Rockefeller retired suggested Capito would have started the race with a narrow lead, and Rockefeller did himself no favors by not being 100 percent pro-coal in recent years, a political problem in a state where coal is still king.

Montana: Baucus, like Rockefeller, would have been in for a very tough race in 2014 if he had run. The Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling found him trailing 49 percent to 44 percent in early 2013 against Rep. Steve Daines, who eventually became the GOP nominee. Baucus announced his retirement in April 2013, and then later resigned to become ambassador to China. Gov. Steve Bullock appointed then-Lt. Gov. John Walsh, a fellow Democrat, to fill the vacancy. Walsh’s campaign, of course, fell apart over the summer under the weight of plagiarism. Now Democrats are stuck with little-known nominee Amanda Curtis, a state representative, and Daines is a huge favorite.

Had Baucus run, would Daines have stood down? He was just elected to his first term in the House in 2012 and might have thought twice about challenging a sitting senator. Baucus versus Daines would have been a lot more competitive than the current race, more like a Toss-up than a Safe Republican pickup, as we assess it now. (Another what if: Former Gov. Brian Schweitzer contemplated running, but then decided against it. He might have been a better candidate than Baucus, who according to that PPP poll trailed Schweitzer by 19 points in a possible primary.)

South Dakota: Given the difficulties that Mike Rounds, the Republican former South Dakota governor, has had putting away this three-way battle for this open seat, it’s not hard to imagine him having a hard time against Johnson, who won a very competitive race in 2002 against now-Sen. John Thune (R) in another Republican-leaning year nationally. After Johnson retired, former Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin or Johnson’s son, U.S. Attorney Brendan Johnson, both would have made good candidates here, but neither ended up running. Democrats were left with Tom Daschle disciple Rick Weiland, who, along with former Republican Sen. Larry Pressler, is giving Rounds fits despite being given the cold shoulder by Harry Reid. If Johnson had run again, or his son or Sandlin became the nominee, the race would probably be a Toss-up. That said, one also has to give a tip of the cap to Rounds, who, like Capito, announced his run for the seat only weeks after the 2012 election. Rounds and Capito running probably helped nudge Johnson and Rockefeller out the door.

(It’s worth noting that, in the case of Senator Johnson, assuming health and an eagerness to run is a leap: He suffered a brain hemorrhage in late 2006 that left him partially paralyzed, though he won an uncompetitive reelection bid in 2008.)

Iowa: Of all the retirements, here’s where an incumbent running most clearly could have meant the difference between defeat and victory for Democrats. Harkin, a five-term incumbent, only won in a blowout once, getting 63 percent in 2008, but he also did not have any razor-thin wins: His previous winning percentages were 54 percent, 52 percent, 54 percent and 55 percent. He probably would not be completely safe if he were up for reelection this year, but he’d almost assuredly be in better shape than the Democrat trying to hold on to the seat, Rep. Bruce Braley, who is a slight underdog to Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst. Interestingly, many top Iowa Republicans took a pass on this race even though Harkin was retiring, but Ernst—who has proven herself to be a much better candidate than almost anyone expected—might win the seat anyway.

Michigan: It appears that Rep. Gary Peters, the Democrat running to replace Levin, is going to keep the Wolverine State blue. In this he owes a considerable amount of thanks to Republican candidate Terri Lynn Land, a widely panned nominee (national Republicans tried to find another candidate to run here). Levin’s retirement did put this race on the map, however, and Democrats and Democratic-affiliated outside groups have spent nearly $17 million to back Peters and attack Land. One has to imagine that with Levin on the ballot, that money would have gone elsewhere. This race is a likely Democratic hold now, and it’s a bright spot for Democrats that could have gone the other way in spite of Michigan’s Democratic leanings. But it would have been more like a sleepy Safe Democratic seat with Levin running.

***

Overall, it’s pretty clear that Republicans got the better of Democrats this year in the retirement department.

Yes, Republicans have had a few retirements of their own this cycle. But the only one that matters for the general election is Georgia, which Sen. Saxby Chambliss is leaving after two terms. Although the GOP is probably a tiny favorite to retain the seat, the race between David Perdue (R) and Michelle Nunn (D) now looks likely to go to a January runoff. Chambliss, so long as he survived his primary, would be a bigger favorite than the untested Perdue, in part because Nunn, a good Democratic recruit, might have passed on a contest against an incumbent.This is not intended to second-guess the decisions of these Democrats to retire: It’s obviously up to them and only them to determine whether they want to run again, and they also deserve some credit for not overstaying their welcomes, as so many other senators have done over the years. Rather, it’s just to illustrate the electoral challenges that these retirements created for Democrats.

To summarize, the likeliest outcome in these five open Democratic Senate seats here in the real world is the following: Republicans win Montana, South Dakota, West Virginia and, likelier than not, Iowa (although that race is very, very close). Democrats hold Michigan.

In the alternate history world above, Democrats hold Iowa and Michigan, and while Republicans still have a good chance to take Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia, they have to spend big money in each in order to do so. In other words, those states would have remained at the front of the line of Democratic dominos, but they would have been harder to knock over than they are now.

That potentially could have affected other races. For instance, after the Obamacare launch fiasco, Republicans added two strong candidates to their roster of Senate candidates: Rep. Cory Gardner in Colorado and former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown in New Hampshire. The national perception at the time they announced back in March and April was that Republicans had three pickups in the bag already, and could thus expand the map. Maybe Brown or Gardner would have been less keen to run in states President Obama won in 2008 and 2012 if the GOP had not already made significant inroads in locking up three states won by Mitt Romney in 2012, freeing up resources that could then be promised to Brown and Gardner.

So what’s the upshot? Without the retirements, Republican odds of taking the Senate, now good, would be lower. It’s impossible to know how much lower – in an election with so many moving parts, there’s an endless list of “what ifs.” But this much is clear: If the GOP wins the Senate on Nov. 4, the post-mortem analysis needs to note that Democratic retirements played a significant role in that victory.",0

The racketeering scheme was conducted “with the consent of higher level officials” in Russia who “shared the proceeds” from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.

Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefiting Putin’s commercial nuclear ambitions.

The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America’s uranium supply.

When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton’s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she “never intervened ... on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter.”

In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom’s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program.

“The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,” a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.

The Obama administration’s decision to approve Rosatom’s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.

That’s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.

The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.

But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI in fact had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee’s decision that Vadim Mikerin — the main Russian overseeing Putin’s nuclear expansion inside the United States — was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.

Then-Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderTrump official criticizes ex-Clinton spokesman over defunding police tweet Obama to speak about George Floyd in virtual town hall GOP group launches redistricting site MORE was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.

Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn’t comment.

Mikerin was a director of Rosatom’s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom’s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom’s new American arm called Tenam.

Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin “did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons … to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,” a November 2014 indictment stated.

His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin’s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show.

In evidentiary affidavits signed in 2014 and 2015, an Energy Department agent assigned to assist the FBI in the case testified that Mikerin supervised a “racketeering scheme” that involved extortion, bribery, money laundering and kickbacks that were both directed by and provided benefit to more senior officials back in Russia.

“As part of the scheme, Mikerin, with the consent of higher level officials at TENEX and Rosatom (both Russian state-owned entities) would offer no-bid contracts to US businesses in exchange for kickbacks in the form of money payments made to some offshore banks accounts,” Agent David Gadren testified.

“Mikerin apparently then shared the proceeds with other co-conspirators associated with TENEX in Russia and elsewhere,” the agent added.

The investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein Rod RosensteinSupreme Court to hear dispute over Democrats' access to Mueller materials Republicans release newly declassified intelligence document on FBI source Steele GOP's Obama-era probes fuel Senate angst MORE, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump Donald John TrumpWayfair refutes QAnon-like conspiracy theory that it's trafficking children Stone rails against US justice system in first TV interview since Trump commuted his sentence Federal appeals court rules Trump admin can't withhold federal grants from California sanctuary cities MORE’s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe Andrew George McCabeShowtime miniseries to feature Jeff Daniels as Comey, Brendan Gleeson as Trump Lisa Page joins MSNBC as legal analyst McCabe, Rosenstein spar over Russia probe MORE, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.

Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven, collusion between Russia and Donald Trump’s campaign during the 2016 election cycle. McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife’s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI. The probe is not focused on McAuliffe's conduct but rather on whether McCabe's attendance violated the Hatch Act or other FBI conflict rules.

Its many twist and turns aside, the FBI nuclear industry case proved a gold mine, in part because it uncovered a new Russian money laundering apparatus that routed bribe and kickback payments through financial instruments in Cyprus, Latvia and Seychelles. A Russian financier in New Jersey was among those arrested for the money laundering, court records show.

The case also exposed a serious national security breach: Mikerin had given a contract to an American trucking firm called Transport Logistics International that held the sensitive job of transporting Russia’s uranium around the United States in return for more than $2 million in kickbacks from some of its executives, court records show.

One of Mikerin’s former employees told the FBI that Tenex officials in Russia specifically directed the scheme to “allow for padded pricing to include kickbacks,” agents testified in one court filing.

Bringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency’s cap.

But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.

The only public statement occurred a year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.

By that time, the criminal cases against Mikerin had been narrowed to a single charge of money laundering for a scheme that officials admitted stretched from 2004 to 2014. And though agents had evidence of criminal wrongdoing they collected since at least 2009, federal prosecutors only cited in the plea agreement a handful of transactions that occurred in 2011 and 2012, well after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States’s approval.

The final court case also made no mention of any connection to the influence peddling conversations the FBI undercover informant witnessed about the Russian nuclear officials trying to ingratiate themselves with the Clintons even though agents had gathered documents showing the transmission of millions of dollars from Russia’s nuclear industry to an American entity that had provided assistance to Bill Clinton’s foundation, sources confirmed to The Hill.

The lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.

On Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin, “a former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison” and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.

Ronald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin’s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged.

“I had no idea this case was being conducted,” a surprised Hosko said in an interview.

Likewise, major congressional figures were also kept in the dark.

Former Rep. Mike Rogers Michael (Mike) Dennis RogersThe Hill's Morning Report - Capitol Hill weighs action on racial justice as protests carry on Bottom line Officials warn Chinese hackers targeting groups developing coronavirus treatments MORE (R-Mich.), who chaired the House Intelligence Committee during the time the FBI probe was being conducted, told The Hill that he had never been told anything about the Russian nuclear corruption case even though many fellow lawmakers had serious concerns about the Obama administration’s approval of the Uranium One deal.

“Not providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them,” he said. “The Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.”

Transcript of Press Availability After House Democratic Caucus Meeting

WASHINGTON – House Democratic Caucus Chairman John Larson (CT), Caucus Vice Chairman Xavier Becerra (CA), and Budget Committee Ranking Member Chris Van Hollen (MD) held a press availability immediately after the Democratic Caucus meeting today on the Debt Limit negotiations. Below is the transcript and video:

Chairman Larson: Well good afternoon and thank you for joining us. I’m proud to be joined by the Vice Chair of our Caucus, Xavier Becerra, and of course, the person whose been taking the lead for Democrats in the budget discussions, Chris Van Hollen.

First of all, I want to start by saying that since Speaker Boehner walked away from the table last Friday we’ve noticed that U.S. stocks and the American people have lost 405 billion dollars. The gravity of this situation, as we continue to repeat, is something that we feel and have felt for a long time could be avoided. Eighteen times under President Reagan the debt ceiling was raised; seven times for George Bush the debt ceiling was raised.

As we have said both on the Floor and here before you, defaulting on the American people is not an option. And yet, what we see unfolding in the former Republican Party is the capitulation to special interests – the special narrow interests of one segment of a party that is controlling the very future of all Americans. Impacting and being willing at all costs to take the nation to the precipice – to the cliff – of disaster.

Time is running out. A proposal is being put forward that we’re told in the Rules Committee – even the Chair of the Rules Committee said it can’t be signed by the President. And so why is that we are putting the American people through this? People who are wondering aloud, what is going on in Washington, D.C.? A t a time when they’re crying out for help and jobs and economic security, a ideological manufactured crisis is unfolding before us. An ideological manufactured crisis no longer controllable by the Speaker because events have unfolded beyond his control.

Washington warned about what would happen in terms of party excesses and what would happen to us if we became a nation where not from without the threats that gather but from within when people seek to destroy the government itself. Imagine standing in the way of Social Security, of veteran’s checks, of paychecks – people’s pensions, and not fully appreciating the gravity of that – only more concerned about bringing government itself down. This is a frightening time for this country – a time when the President of the United States at least has stood there as Horatio at the Bridge and continues to offer calm and sanguine advice and encourages people to come together when forces here won’t even allow it to happen. And whether it’s a cloture vote in the Senate, or whether it’s the Tea Party in the House. This is a travesty that this is happening to the American people.

This is a manufactured crisis. This shouldn’t be happening. We should take this from the plate of the American people and get on with the business of putting this country back to work. That’s where this discussion should be.

And with that, let me yield to the Vice Chair of the Caucus, Xavier Becerra.

Vice Chair Xavier Becerra: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.

I believe most Americans are trying to figure out where things stand just four short days before we get to this point. Actually, three short days before we get to this point that this country has never seen. And what makes it difficult for the American people to understand what’s going on is that Speaker Boehner indicated a week ago that he was walking away from the negotiations because he had a better plan. Well, we’ve since seen that the Republicans can’t agree to their own plan here in the House of Representatives and they are clearly feuding amongst themselves, and while they’ve been feuding, as the Chairman pointed out, we’ve seen Americans lose about 400 billion dollars worth of value.

In five business days Americans have lost about 400 billion dollars worth of value in their wealth. That’s about half of what the Republicans we’re hoping to save in their ten year plan. Five days versus five years of a ten year plan. That’s what happens when you feud and you don’t do your work. The failure of the Republicans is costing not just the Republicans in their party; it’s costing Americans a great deal of money.

But we’ve seen this before and we’ve seen described before when the tail wags the dog. In this case we see the tail wagging the elephant, and it’s unfortunate that Republicans don’t seem t be listening to the American public. The American public has said over and over again, get this done, do it bipartisanly, and make sure it’s balanced—and in the process, don’t make Social Security, which hasn’t added a single cent to these deficits, pay for this deficit reduction. Don’t make Medicare recipients lose their Medicare benefits to pay for protecting the tax loopholes for special interests—and we understand that today Republicans have admitted that they can’t pass the bill that we are debating on the floor right now.

None other than the Chairman of the Rules Committee, David Dreier, who is managing the debate on this bill has said that he understands that this bill is going nowhere. So, three short days before we’re told we may plunge into the abyss, and Republicans are debating a bill which the Chairman of their Rules Committee is saying he understands that this bill will go nowhere. Clearly the tail is wagging the elephant today.

Rep. Van Hollen: I want to thank my colleagues here for their leadership in the Caucus and just pick up where my friend Xavier Becerra left off about this comment with the tail wagging the elephant because I think in the last twenty-four hours we’ve confirmed what many people suspected, which is that the Tea Party Republicans may be a noisy and effective protest movement, but they’re unfit to govern. They’re unfit to govern, and it is time for Speaker Boehner to do what he called for himself some time ago, which is to have that adult moment.

And unfortunately, rather than work to reach across the aisle and form true bipartisan compromise for the good of the country, he’s moving in the wrong direction. He’s now taken the bill, which was unacceptable and won’t pass in its original form, back to Rules Committee to make it even more extreme to cater again to the Tea Party wing of the Republican party. That’s not going to get us where we need to go, and the American people watching this process know that. You now have House Republicans having walked out of the Biden talks, two times out of the talks with the President. They rejected the proposal put forward by the Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, originally. Then they rejected their own Speaker’s proposal, but instead of working across the aisle to solve the problem, unfortunately the Speaker’s made that problem even worse and is taking this in the wrong direction. This is, as my colleague said, a totally self-inflicted wound we’re inflicting on the American people everyday. It is a manufactured crisis, so you have to ask yourself, why? Why are they doing this to the country? Why are they playing kamikaze pilot with the American economy? Their answer—what they tell you—is that they’ve got to reduce the deficit. That’s what they say, but if you look at their actions that’s just not true because every time someone’s put forward a balanced deficit plan they’ve said no, and it turns out their real objective is not to reduce the deficit because if that was your objective you’d be willing to be to eliminate one penny in subsidies for the gas companies for the purpose of deficit reduction. We’ve challenged them. We want them to put up the hand.

The first Republican that says they’re willing to have one penny from closing tax loopholes go to deficit reduction, please come talk to us. If you’re really interested in deficit reduction, you’d be willing to ask the big oil companies to stop taking all the taxpayer money, but they haven’t. That’s not their objective. Their objective, as my colleagues have said, is to manufacture this crisis, try and impose on the American people a very extreme agenda that involves ending the Medicare guarantee, slashing Medicaid, slashing education—that’s what they’re about, not about deficit reduction. When they get serious about deficit reduction in a balanced way, we hope they’ll come talk to us.

Chairman Larson: Thank you Chris. Let me just say that we concluded our Caucus and we started our Caucus with the unity I think demonstrates the importance of this nature to the American—of everything that’s unfolding to the American people, and that unity stems from our defense of Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. Let me throw it open to questions.

Q: Beyond all this theater, are you hearing of any serious talks going on either between the Senate and the House or amongst Senate leaders.

Chairman Larson: Well we’re not privy, of course, to the discussions that take place in the inner sanctum over in the Senate, but we hear there are discussions that are going on, and I don’t know if Chris would want to comment on that further.

Congressman Van Hollen: (Inaudible) . . . I think there may be the beginning of discussions between Senator Reid and Senator McConnell, but we’re not familiar with the details.

Chairman Larson: Yes.

Q: So the House Republicans are now renewing this push for a balanced budget amendment to be passed before the second stage of this…

Chairman Larson: Totally realistic proposal, huh? (Laughter)

Vice Chair Xavier Becerra: Did you like the first version of the movie.

Q: …That they’re open to the balanced budget amendment that was passed in the House in the late 1990’s Does that...

Chairman Larson: Let’s call this for what it is. You know, and the initial question is aside from more theater, this is just more theater, and with the theater is more a further move to the right and a more extreme position and you know, you can put the wings on this pig, but it still won’t fly.

Q: Do you see political motivations for this? Does the balanced budget amendment just essentially give Republicans an issue to talk about between now until the election?

Chairman Larson: Well, I think if you’re a Tea Party member you’ve got to be—and listen they come here in believing that they are patriots and they’re full of the pledges that they have taken throughout the campaign. But here, I think they’ve forgotten, as Chris pointed out, that we pledge allegiance to this nation, not to Grover Norquist or to any other tax pledge, and where they’re taking this country is unprecedented. It’s never happened before, and while they may take a great deal of pride in that, the reality is the the reality that looms in the American people, best stated by a constituent of mine who said “do they not understand that we’re in the dark abyss of uncertainty?” And that’s true in global markets, national markets, in our business community, but most importantly, for households. I mean, the American people do not deserve this. They deserve far better from their government.

Rep. Van Hollen: You know, our Republican colleagues are trotting this out because it sounds good on its surface, it’s really a way of just passing the buck, and what’s interesting is our Republican colleagues who complain about activist judges making decisions. The reality is, at the end of the day, you would be asking judges to enforce the balanced budget amendment. Do they want federal judges to be deciding whether to cut Medicare or to raise taxes? This is just a device to pass the buck and delay confronting the real challenge, which is all of us getting together to hammer this out in a balanced way. And so I know it’s a nice sounding thing, we encourage the American people to take a close look at what it really does, because it’s a way for the Members to escape responsibility and ultimately, lay it on the doorstep of a federal judge. That’s not what our Founders anticipated—the Founders expected the Congress and the President to deal with the budget, not to pass the buck to a federal judge to raise taxes or cut Medicare or education.

Vice Chairman Becerra: Can I add something, and James, correct me if I’m wrong. Eleven thousand times since 1789, I wanted to check on this, constitutional amendment since 1789 we’ve had eleven thousand attempts to amend the Constitution since 1789. 27 amendments have been passed, ten of them in one shot with the Bill of Rights. And so, we’re now hearing that Republicans may want two, three days before they plunge us into the economic abyss, propose the eleven-thousand and first constitutional amendment so that in less than three days we pass that when it’s taken over 230 years to pass 27 out of the eleven thousand that were proposed. That’s the height of ridicule that I think you can say we can take these efforts by those who have not yet gotten serious about dealing with what is very serious for any American family, and that is keeping your credit rating—and Republicans are about to allow America’s credit rating to go down the drain.

Q: Senator Harkin today said that if worst comes to worst the President should man up and invoke the 14th Amendment. Is that something you support?

Chairman Larson: Well, I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, if you know—I know the President has resisted this and—but he is and still remains Horatio at the Bridge and let us hope—I mean it’s our sincere hope and let me again acknowledge and applaud the efforts of our colleagues, Chris Van Hollen and Jim Clyburn and Steny and Nancy, who have been in the room representing our concerns—it is our hope that we will be able to reach a legislative conclusion, if not, and faced with these perilous events that could unfold, then I share, and I know Jim Clyburn does and others, that perhaps the President reluctantly may have to do this. Certainly something that he said he would not.

Q: I know that part of the short term solution – both parties are not really proposing that right now, but since the clock is ticking down so close how about a short – you know, three day, five day, seven day just to get this through? Is that something that you’re starting to think about.

Chairman Larson: Well, how many more opportunities do you think should be provided for people to get up and walk away from the table? I mean, we sat through and we saw the theater. Chris witnessed Eric Cantor walk away from the discussions with the Vice President as soon as any balance was brought into the discussion. We witnessed then Mitch McConnell coming up with a proposal along with Harry Reid, we watched them walk away from that proposal. We then witnessed, and throughout this the President continuing to reach out—we then witnessed a bipartisan Group of Six, as they like to be called, three Republicans and three Democrats come up with a proposal, they walked away from that. They walked away from their own Speaker’s proposal and from the President’s proposal. I think it was Carolyn Maloney who said if Barack Obama came up with a cure for the common cold or a cure for cancer, they would walk away from that as well.

So, I think the time for politics, and whether its extending it out six months so that they can continue this ideological manufactured crisis, I think that that’s wrong headed, and clearly if they all came together and said that we have a bill that we’re going to put on the Floor tomorrow and vote on and it was laid out in detail. I think the President said yeah, he would acknowledge that, but we haven’t seen anything close to that.

Vice Chairman Becerra: Can I add—this is clearly a dollars and cents issue, these are facts on the ground, decisions that have to be made because money has to be paid, but at the same time we’re talking about something that’s intangible, somewhat abstract that perhaps is even more important, that is the full faith and credit of the United States of America. What it means to be the U. S. of A., the most relied upon democracy ever, where money still runs to the U.S. when there’s trouble around the world—and if you want to inspire confidence, not just in international markets among the bankers of the world, but if you want to inspire confidence back home on Main Street, I dare say that the last thing you want to do is pass another two or three day extension to try to get somewhere, because I don’t believe any businessman or woman back home on Main Street would budget this way, or try to run a business this way and I dare say, the largest economy in the world should operate this way either.

So, It’s time to, as Senator Harkin said, man up—let’s do something, we can do this. This was totally manufactured as a crisis. We can get out of it today. We just have to do the right thing. And so, I would hope that Republicans would understand that they will inspire little confidence in the American family if they tell us we can kick this can down the road for a few more days.

Hillary Clinton's advantage over Donald Trump has narrowed to just three points — resulting in a dead-heat general-election contest with more than five months to go until November, according to a new national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.

Clinton, who remains a heavy favorite to win the Democrat nomination, leads the presumptive GOP nominee 46 percent to 43 percent among registered voters, a difference that is within the poll’s margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.1 percentage points. In April, Clinton held an 11-point advantage over Trump, 50 percent to 39 percent, and had led him consistently by double digits since December.

In a more hypothetical matchup, Democrat Bernie Sanders leads Trump by 15 points, 54 percent to 39 percent.

Looking inside the numbers of her race against Trump, Clinton holds the edge among African Americans (88 percent to 9 percent), Latinos (68 percent to 20 percent), women (51 percent to 38 percent) and those ages 18 to 34 (55 percent to 32 percent).

Trump, meanwhile, is ahead among whites (52 percent to 36 percent), seniors (52 percent to 41 percent), men (49 percent to 40 percent) and independents (42 percent to 37 percent).

The NBC/WSJ poll — conducted May 15-19 — comes after Trump became the Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee, but also as the ongoing Clinton-vs.-Sanders Democratic race has become more contentious in recent days.

Republicans are now supporting Trump over Clinton by an 86 percent-to-6 percent margin, which is up from 72 percent to 13 percent a month ago, suggesting that GOP voters are consolidating around their presumptive nominee.

Complete Coverage: Decision 2016

While Democrats are backing Clinton by an 83 percent-to-9 percent clip, just 66 percent of Democratic primary voters preferring Sanders support Clinton in a matchup against Trump (compared with 88 percent of Clinton primary voters who favor Sanders in a hypothetical general-election contest). Those numbers underscore Clinton’s challenge in winning over Sanders voters once the Democratic primary contest concludes.

Mr. and Mrs. Unpopular

Trump and Clinton are currently the two most unpopular likely presidential nominees in the history of the NBC/WSJ poll.

Thirty four percent of registered voters have a positive opinion of Clinton, versus 54 percent who have a negative opinion (-20) — a slight uptick from her minus-24 score last month.

Trump's rating is even worse than Clinton’s: Twenty nine percent have a positive opinion of him, while 58 percent have a negative opinion (-29) — an improvement from his minus-41 score in April.

“This has never been matched, or even close to being matched,” Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who conducted the survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff, says of these negative ratings for Trump and Clinton.

By contrast, Sanders is in positive territory. Forty-three percent have a positive view of the Vermont senator, versus 36 percent who have a negative view (+7). One difference Clinton and Sanders: Clinton’s rating among Democratic voters supporting Sanders is 38 percent positive, 41 percent negative (-3); Sanders’ rating among Clinton supporters is 54 percent positive, 23 percent negative (+31).

President Obama’s overall score in the current NBC/WSJ poll is at 49 percent positive, 41 percent negative (+8).

Forty Seven Percent Would Consider a Third-Party Candidate

Asked if they would consider a third-party candidate if Clinton and Trump were the major party nominees, 47 percent of registered voters say yes -- a higher percentage than those who said yes on a similar question in 2008 and 2012.

Fifty percent of voters say they would not consider a third-party candidate.

The NBC/WSJ poll was conducted May 15-19 of 1,000 registered voters, including 450 cell phone-only respondents and another 46 reached on a cell but who also have a landline. The overall margin of error is plus-minus 3.1 percentage points.",0

politifact15386,"OFFICIAL: Rudy Giuliani Officially Resigns, Trump’s Legal Team on Its Last LegAfter Trump’s lead dog attorney, John Dowd, up and quit, the president ran into trouble trying to find his replacement. After a long list of failed attempts to bring on high-profile attorneys, Trump ultimately settled on former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani. However, things haven’t gone quite as expected since the inception of Giuliani. He’s caused the president more harm than good, notably when he contradicted the president’s story regarding the hush payment sent to Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election.

Now, it appears that instead of getting kicked off the team by Trump, the president is desperate enough to need Rudy in a full-time role.

On April 19th, Rudy officially went on leave from the law firm Greenberg Traurig. Today, the executive chairman of the firm, Richard Rosenbaum, announced that Rudy has formally resigned from the firm.

Rosenbaum said in a statement:

“When Rudy Giuliani took an unpaid leave of absence from the firm, his intent was to play a limited role, for a short period of time, to address specific matters for President Trump. After recognizing that this work is all consuming and is lasting longer than initially anticipated, Rudy has determined it is best for him to resign from the firm, effective May 9th. I have a great deal of respect [for him] … and consider him a friend.”

The key takeaway is the fact that Trump is desperate enough to need throwaway lawyer Rudy Giuliani.

politifact6473,"Letter to the Honorable John Boehner providing an estimate for H.R. 6079, the Repeal of Obamacare ActCBO and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) have estimated the direct spending and revenue effects of H.R. 6079, the Repeal of Obamacare Act, as passed by the House of Representatives on July 11, 2012. H.R. 6079 would repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), with the exception of one subsection that has no budgetary effect. This estimate reflects the spending and revenue projections in CBO’s March 2012 baseline as adjusted to take into account the effects of the recent Supreme Court decision regarding the ACA.

For various reasons discussed in the report, the estimated budgetary effects of repealing the ACA by enacting H.R. 6079 are close to, but not equivalent to, an estimate of the budgetary effects of the ACA with the signs reversed.

What Is the Impact of Repealing the ACA on the Federal Budget?

Assuming that H.R. 6079 is enacted near the beginning of fiscal year 2013, CBO and JCT estimate that, on balance, the direct spending and revenue effects of enacting that legislation would cause a net increase in federal budget deficits of $109 billion over the 2013–2022 period. Specifically, we estimate that H.R. 6079 would reduce direct spending by $890 billion and reduce revenues by $1 trillion between 2013 and 2022, thus adding $109 billion to federal budget deficits over that period.

What Major Components Result in the Net Increase in Deficits?

Deficits would be increased under H.R. 6079 because the net savings from eliminating the insurance coverage provisions would be more than offset by the combination of other spending increases and revenue reductions:

The ACA contains a set of provisions designed to expand health insurance coverage, which, on net, are projected to cost the government money. The costs of those coverage expansions—which include the cost of the subsidies to be provided through the exchanges, increased outlays for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and tax credits for certain small employers—will be partially offset by penalty payments from employers and uninsured individuals, revenues from the excise tax on high-premium insurance plans, and net savings from other coverage-related effects. By repealing those coverage provisions of the ACA, over the 2013–2022 period, H.R. 6079 would yield gross savings of an estimated $1,677 billion and net savings (after accounting for the offsets just mentioned) of $1,171 billion.

The ACA also includes a number of other provisions related to health care that are estimated to reduce net federal outlays (primarily for Medicare). By repealing those provisions, H.R. 6079 would increase other direct spending in the next decade by an estimated $711 billion.

The ACA includes a number of provisions that are estimated to increase federal revenues (apart from the effect of provisions related to insurance coverage), mostly by increasing the Hospital Insurance (HI) payroll tax and extending it to net investment income for high- income taxpayers, and imposing fees or excise taxes on certain manufacturers and insurers. Repealing those provisions would reduce revenues by an estimated $569 billion over the 2013–2022 period.

What Would be the Effect of Repealing the ACA on Discretionary Spending?

In addition to those effects on direct spending and revenues, by CBO’s estimates, repeal of the ACA would reduce the need for appropriations to the Internal Revenue Service by between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years. Repealing the ACA would also reduce the need for appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services by between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years, CBO estimates. Such savings might be reflected in reductions in total discretionary spending, or they might free up room for additional spending for other purposes under the caps on discretionary appropriations that were established by the Budget Control Act of 2011. H.R. 6079 would also repeal a number of authorizations for appropriations, which, if left in place, might or might not result in additional appropriations.

Why Are These Estimates Uncertain?

Projections of the budgetary impact of H.R. 6079 are quite uncertain because they are based, in large part, on projections of the effects of the ACA, which are themselves highly uncertain. Assessing the effects of making broad changes in the nation’s health care and health insurance systems requires estimates of a broad array of technical, behavioral, and economic factors. Separating the incremental effects of the provisions in the ACA that affect spending for ongoing programs and revenue streams becomes more uncertain as the time since enactment grows. The recent Supreme Court decision that essentially made the expansion of the Medicaid program a state option has also increased the uncertainty of the estimates. However, CBO and JCT, in consultation with outside experts, have devoted a great deal of care and effort to the analysis of health care legislation in the past few years, and the agencies have strived to develop estimates that are in the middle of the distribution of possible outcomes.",0

politifact12755,"Pastors To Protest IRS Rules on Political AdvocacyOn Sept. 28, pastors from 20 states will give politically based sermons from the pulpit as part of a protest organized by the Alliance Defense Fund, a conservative legal-advocacy group. The protest will challenge an Internal Revenue Code restriction that limits the political activities of charitable organizations – including churches and other religious groups – that are exempt from taxation. According to the Internal Revenue Code, religious groups may lose their tax-exempt status if they officially endorse a political candidate. The ADF says that if its protest leads the Internal Revenue Service to penalize houses of worship for their pastors’ political advocacy, ADF will bring a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of these penalties.

To discuss the ADF protest and IRS restrictions on the political activities of religious organizations, the Pew Forum turns to church-state scholar Robert W. Tuttle.

Featuring:

Robert W. Tuttle, David R. and Sherry Kirschner Berz Research Professor of Law and Religion, The George Washington University Law School

Interviewer:

Jesse Merriam, Research Associate, Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life

Question & Answer

Before 1954, section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code permitted nonprofit organizations to endorse political candidates while remaining exempt from federal income tax. But in 1954, the U.S. Congress amended this part of the code to say that a charitable organization loses its tax-exempt status if it intervenes in a political campaign. Why did Congress add this restriction?

Many members of Congress, including Lyndon B. Johnson, a senator at the time, voted for the amendment because they were concerned about nonprofit organizations funding their opponents’ political campaigns. But because there was little debate over the amendment or how it would influence churches, we don’t know precisely why Congress enacted the amendment.

Notably, the 1954 amendment is often misunderstood as limiting political advocacy, but the rule’s actual purpose has to do with political contributions. Under the Internal Revenue Code, there are many different kinds of tax-exempt organizations. For example, section 527 of the code exempts all sorts of political organizations from federal income tax. But organizations that qualify as charitable groups under section 501(c)(3) are special because donors to these organizations may deduct their contributions from their own federal income taxes. So a primary purpose of the 1954 amendment was to prevent donors from deducting political contributions from their taxes.

Why is the Alliance Defense Fund so interested in eliminating this restriction?

The ADF opposes the restriction because the rule requires churches to choose between actively participating in political campaigns, on the one hand, and accepting tax-deductible donations, on the other hand. As a result, if a church wanted to promote or oppose a particular political candidate, the church would be required to create a separate organization to do so. Although this separate organization would be exempt from taxes, contributors could not take a tax deduction for their donations to this organization.

The ADF believes that this restriction takes political activity out of the heart of a congregation’s life. For example, a congregation that wanted to retain its tax exemption under section 501(c)(3) could not include political activity in its worship service unless the worship service was financed by a separate organization. Moreover, ADF believes that because IRS officials must examine the content of sermons or other religious messages to determine whether a church has improperly engaged in political advocacy, IRS enforcement of the rule entangles the government in the operation of religious organizations.

If ADF’s protest leads to a constitutional challenge in court, what arguments might ADF make?

The ADF would almost certainly argue that the 1954 amendment violates the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause, which prohibits the government from regulating religious organizations more strictly than their secular counterparts. Similarly, ADF will likely argue that the amendment violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a 1993 federal statute that prohibits the federal government from imposing a “substantial burden” on a religious organization unless the government demonstrates that it must impose that burden to achieve a “compelling government interest.” The ADF will also likely argue that the restriction violates the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause, which prohibits the government from regulating speech on the basis of its content. Finally, ADF might also claim that IRS enforcement of the 1954 amendment violates the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause by requiring the IRS to scrutinize sermons or other religious messages, thus excessively entangling government and religion.

How might the government defend the 1954 amendment?

The government will likely defend the 1954 amendment by arguing that the rule does not violate congregations’ rights under the Free Exercise Clause or RFRA because the restriction treats religious organizations just like other charitable and educational organizations. Moreover, the government would say, the restriction does not bar congregations from participating in campaigns; it only prohibits donors from making tax-deductible political contributions. Likewise, the government will likely argue, the restriction does not violate the Free Speech Clause because the restriction does not prohibit the congregations from making political statements; it only bars them from using tax-deductible donations to do so. Finally, in response to ADF’s Establishment Clause argument, the government will likely argue that there is no excessive entanglement of government and religion because the IRS does not need to evaluate a sermon’s theological merit to determine whether the sermon promotes a politician.

How do you think a court might evaluate these arguments?

It’s always difficult to predict how a court might decide a hypothetical case because a court’s decision often turns on a case’s particular facts. But past decisions give us a pretty good basis for guessing that a court would uphold the constitutionality of the 1954 amendment’s application to religious organizations.

The most relevant case on this issue is Branch Ministries v. Rossotti (2000), a case in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the 1954 amendment’s constitutionality. That case arose after a congregation advocated for a presidential candidate, prompting the IRS to revoke the congregation’s 501(c)(3) status. The congregation claimed that this revocation violated the Free Exercise and Free Speech clauses. But the D.C. Circuit Court rejected both of these arguments on the ground that the congregation was still free to engage in political speech and activities.

The D.C. Circuit Court’s reasoning in this case relied heavily on two U.S. Supreme Court decisions, Regan v. Taxation with Representation (1983) and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v. Board of Equalization (1990). In Regan, the high court held that 501(c)(3) status provides a monetary benefit to certain tax-exempt organizations because it allows their donors to take a tax deduction for contributions. Therefore, the court concluded, the 1954 amendment does not violate the Free Speech Clause because the amendment merely withholds a speech subsidy rather than restricts speech.

Similarly, in the Jimmy Swaggart Ministries case, the Supreme Court held that a tax imposed equally on all organizations does not violate the Free Exercise Clause. The court held that although the tax may increase the cost of religious activity, the tax does not impose a “substantial burden” on religious exercise because it does not prevent religious organizations from engaging in religious activity.

If ADF challenged the 1954 amendment’s application to religious organizations, I think it is very likely that a court would agree with the Branch Ministries decision and reject the challenge. In the years since the Regan and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries cases, there have been a number of important changes in free exercise and free speech law, but those changes have only reinforced these decisions.

If the 1954 amendment was lifted for religious organizations but not for other charitable organizations, would that raise a problem under the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause, which generally prohibits the government from favoring religion over nonreligion?

This is an even more difficult and complicated question than the previous one, and I could see a court going either way. On the one hand, courts usually uphold legislative efforts to relieve burdens on religious activity, even if those burdens are not so “substantial” as to require an exemption under RFRA. So if Congress lifted the 1954 amendment, courts might be inclined to defer to the legislative judgment that the amendment should not apply to religious organizations.

On the other hand, courts might be more skeptical of such a religion-specific exemption from the 1954 amendment because this exemption would potentially provide religious organizations with a very significant benefit not extended to other charitable organizations. Indeed, if the 1954 amendment applied to all 501(c)(3) organizations except religious ones, those who contribute to congregations engaged in political activity would be allowed to take an income tax deduction for their contributions – thus offsetting some of the actual cost of the donation – while contributors to other political organizations would not be allowed to deduct their contributions. In other words, the government would effectively subsidize the political activities of congregations.

Such a subsidy raises serious questions under the Establishment Clause. In Texas Monthly v. Bullock (1989), the Supreme Court held that a Texas law that exempted religious publications but not other publications from sales taxes violated the Establishment Clause because the exemption effectively subsidized religious publications. The court explained that although the government may alleviate special burdens on religious activity, the sales tax did not present such a special burden because it applied equally to both religious and nonreligious publications.

So the Texas Monthly decision strongly suggests that lifting the 1954 amendment only for religious organizations would violate the Establishment Clause. But that doesn’t mean that the present Supreme Court would definitely find a constitutional violation if Congress lifted the restriction only for religious organizations. Indeed, because the present court has a much narrower view of the Establishment Clause than the court that decided Texas Monthly, the present court might be willing to overrule the Texas Monthly decision. The ADF is no doubt hoping that this will be the case. As I said, it’s very difficult to guess how a court would decide this issue.",0

President John H. Cox? President Dal Lamagna? These names might not sound familiar, but these guys have also reported raising money for a presidential bid this cycle—and in some cases have actually collected more than (slightly) better-known candidates. Cox, a Republican described as a ""Reagan fiscal and social conservative"" on his website, has raised $586,080 this year, which is more than Alan Keyes has raised, and Cox has more cash on hand than the newcomer. Lamagna, a ""progressive activist"" who has produced three documentaries about the Iraq war, has raised $376,400, which is more than Mike Gravel raised. Both Cox and Lamagna, however, have accrued pretty significant debt. Cox is in the hole $1.1 million, almost twice more than he's brought in, and Lamagna's debt is $349,000. But because they are both funding their own campaigns, they owe the money to themselves. Other lesser-known candidates are libertarians or members of other third parties. Military Continues to Give to Paul, Obama (10/19/07, 5:30 pm)

Despite his anti-war stance, or perhaps because of it, Ron Paul continues to collect more money from members of the U.S. military than any other presidential candidate, including John McCain, a Vietnam War prisoner who backs the administration's policy in Iraq. Paul brought in at least $53,670 from the uniformed services, compared to McCain's $40,000. Democrat Barack Obama, who opposed the resolution to go to Iraq from the start, is the number-two recipient with at least $45,200. This trend may exemplify growing dissatisfaction among members of the military with the administration's handling of foreign policy, especially in Iraq. Democrats have received 35 percent of the total $319,000 in contributions from uniformed service members this year. By comparison, in 2000, the last presidential race before the Iraq war began, Democrats received only 18 percent of contributions from the military. *Read a Capital Eye story from September about military giving: The Other Iraq Surge Battle of the Sexes (10/19/07, 12:45 pm)

Hillary Clinton, the only woman running for president, is bringing in more money from female donors than any other candidate. But she doesn't have the largest number of female donors. That distinction belongs to Democrat Barack Obama, who has so far collected money from at least 22,045 women giving more than $200, compared to Clinton's 17,539. (Only donors who give more than $200 are itemized in campaign finance reports, so it's impossible to determine a gender breakdown for smaller donors.) Clinton is nearly tied with Democrat Dennis Kucinich in the percentage of total funds coming from women—about 44 percent for both of them. Among Republicans, a larger number of women have given to Mitt Romney than any other candidate in the party, 8,801 donors giving a total of $12.1 million, or about 32 percent of his total. But with about 35 percent of his funds from women, dropout Sam Brownback's receipts from females make up the largest percentage of his total compared to all other GOP candidates. Hedge Funds and Private Equity Invest in Giuliani, Democrats (10/19/07, 11:15 am)

As senators, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are debating legislation that would significantly increase taxes on hedge funds and private equity firms. As presidential hopefuls, the two are raking in money from the industry, while Mitt Romney, who made his fortune in private equity, is seeing a decline in contributions from them. Nearly 61 percent of the $5.7 million in donations from hedge funds and private equity firms went to Democrats during the third quarter. Although Romney brought in $597,800 during the 1st Quarter—more than any other candidate from either party—he is down to $76,350 for the 3rd Quarter and $944,275 for the year. Clinton has collected $966,300 and Obama has collected $940,000 in the last nine months. The real winner of hedge fund and private equity money seems to be Republican Rudy Giuliani. He has amassed $1.1 million from the wealthy industry so far.

politifact627,"McCain in ColoradoUpdated: ASPEN — Senator John McCain is meeting with his top campaign advisers and donors here as they review his choices for vice president and strategize in advance of the Democratic convention.

They gathered as Mr. McCain gave a freewheeling performance at the Aspen Institute Thursday, where he discussed the conflict in the Caucasus and challenged a member of the audience to back up his accusations that Mr. McCain was a flip-flopper and where he lamented his own lack of appreciation for art and music.

And at a fund-raising event earlier in the day — one of three –he told his donors that the daily tracking polls basically showed him tied with Senator Barack Obama, but he still called himself the underdog.

“That’s what I relish and that’s what I like,’’ he said at the first fund-raiser, at the home of Frank and Pat Lynch in Edwards, Colo. He added that Mr. Obama has such a large staff that his entire campaign is “about the size of Senator Obama’s foreign-policy team.’’



Many on his team, including Steve Schmidt and Rick Davis, gathered here, along with Senator John Thune of South Dakota, Gov. Jon Huntsman of Utah, former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Jack Kemp, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1996. Colorado itself is considered one of the closest swing states in the country and is, of course, the site of the Democratic convention, which starts in a little more than a week.

Mr. McCain spent almost 90 minutes in a public conversation here in front of about 1,200 people at the Aspen Institute with Walter Isaacson, president of the institute, former chairman of CNN and the former editor of Time magazine. During the discussion, Mr. McCain criticized Vladimir V. Putin, Russia’s president turned prime minister and he called the current situation between Russia and Georgia, “the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War.”

“My friends, we have reached a crisis, the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War,” Mr. McCain said. “This is an act of aggression. And historians and time will tell us how provoked it was or what actions the Georgian government took, et cetera. but the fact is this aggression is far exceeded any provocation that might have been inflicted on South Ossetia and Abkhazia.”

Mr. McCain was by turns impassioned in defending his record and wistful about his lack of cultural education. He also drew laughter when he objected to the idea of raising taxes to keep Social Security solvent, saying, “I have to be against the tax increases, as you know,” and drew groans when he suggested the price of gas here was $3.79 a gallon; in Aspen, it’s closer to $5 a gallon.

At one point, a member of the audience accused Mr. McCain of having moved away from his “maverick” stances and challenged him on his recent statement that Mr. Obama would rather lose a war if it meant winning an election. Did he mean to say that Mr. Obama was a traitor?

In a heated back and forth, Mr. McCain challenged the man, who said he was from Arizona and had voted for him, to specify the positions he had changed positions on. The man cited tax cuts and his fealty to the “Christian right.”

Mr. McCain said he had not supported President Bush’s tax cuts because they were not balanced by cuts in spending but that he had supported different tax cuts. And he said he was someone who sought reconciliation, both with the likes of the late Rev. Jerry Falwell and the Vietnamese, who had held him captive during the war.

As for whether he thought Mr. Obama was a “traitor,” Mr. McCain did not repeat the word and avoided a yes-or-no answer but gave an intense response.

He said he himself had been called “disloyal” by Republicans when he said the United States was losing the war in Iraq and that its strategy wouldn’t work. He said he had been “declared dead,” but he was reminded of Chairman Mao’s saying that “it’s always darkest before it’s totally black.” But, he added, Mr. Obama said the surge would fail, “he voted to cut off funding for the men and women who are serving in Iraq, he refuses to acknowledge that the surge succeeded.” He added: “I think he’s wrong and I think he used the issue of Iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party,” he said, to sustained applause.

He also implicitly criticized President Bush for not asking more of the nation after the 9/11 attacks. He said that by urging people to go shopping, “we passed up an opportunity” to ask them to join the Peace Corps or perform some sort of national service.

He also said he opposed a military draft because it wouldn’t work. “The kind of war they’re fighting requires long-term commitment,” he said. And a draft now would probably be as unjust as it was during Vietnam, he said, when people of privilege could avoid it.

On the lighter side, he joked about having once said that ABBA’s “Dancing Queen” was his favorite singing group, correcting the record to say his favorite song was Frank Sinatra’s “I’ve Got You Under My Skin.”

He said that if he’s “lacking in anything,” it is an appreciation for music and art and “the other great things in life,” partly because he missed out on popular music while he was a POW. Then he began defending ABBA adamantly.

“Everybody says, ‘I hate ABBA, Oh, ABBA, how terrible, blah, blah, blah.’How come everybody goes to ‘Mamma Mia!?’” he said. “Everybody goes! They’ve been selling out for years.”

After another question about Iraq, he voluntarily returned to the subject of his arrested aesthetic development.

“I appreciate art,” he declared. “If there’s one thing I’m going to do and I have the opportunity, it’s to take a class in art.” He said he had seen a lot of art in the homes of supporters recently and that his daughter had graduated from Columbia with a degree in art history. He said he loved his education at the Naval Academy, he said, “but some of the things weren’t there that I would like to see.”

He then added, “But I make no excuses for my taste in music.”",0
politifact14960,"Haiti Official Getting Ready To Testify Against Clinton Foundation Corruption NEXT WEEK, Found DEAD With “Gunshot to the head”It’s absolutely clear that the Clinton Foundation has faced some honest reports of stealing from impoverished Haitians devastated in the 2008 Hurricane Hanna, and straight through their own foundation. For years the Haitians have been struggling and protesting outside the Clinton Foundation offices over the robbery. The money taken was donated by the individuals and business directly to the Clinton Foundation, thinking they were going to receive aid. However, the opposite it true. The money never even made it to the poorest of the poor. Now we have one man ready to testify against the corrupt Clinton Foundation in the upcoming week. However, the 50 year old man, a former Haitian government official Klaus Eberwein, was found dead in his Miami home with a “gunshot to the head” that’s been ruled a “suicide” by the Miami-Dade’s medical examiner records supervisor.

Klaus Eberwein, a former Haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice next week, has been found dead in Miami. He was 50.

Eberwein was due to appear next Tuesday before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission where he was widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors.

Eberwein, who had acknowledged his life was in danger, was a fierce critic of the Clinton Foundation’s activities in the Caribbean island, where he served as director general of the government’s economic development agency, Fonds d’assistance économique et social, for three years. According to Eberwein, a paltry 0.6% of donations granted by international donors to the Clinton Foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting Haitians actually ended up in the hands of Haitian organizations. A further 9.6% ended up with the Haitian government. The remaining 89.8% – or $5.4 billion – was funneled to non-Haitian organizations.

“The Clinton Foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace,” Eberwein said at a protest outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan last year.

The former director general of Haiti, who also served as an advisor to Haitian President Michel Martelly, was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in Haiti, Muncheez, and even has a pizza — the Klaus Special — named after him.

According to the Haiti Libre newspaper, Eberwein was said to be in “good spirits“, with plans for the future. His close friends and business partners are shocked by the idea he may have committed suicide.

“It’s really shocking,” said Muncheez’s owner Gilbert Bailly. “We grew up together; he was like family.” –Your News Wire

Americans were warned about the crooked dealings of the Clinton Crime family when in September of 2016, former Senate President of Haiti, Bernard Sansaricq, shocked a large crowd at a Trump campaign event in Little Haiti, FL. Sansaricq stood up during the public event and relayed his account of the Clinton’s dirty dealings in Haiti while he was still in office. To his credit, candidate Donald Trump allowed Sansaricq to speak his mind, and to expose the crimes of the Clinton’s, who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our White House.

Sansaricq claimed he begged the Clinton Administration not to invade Haiti. His request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the White House who encouraged him to “side” with the Clinton Administration and he would “be the richest man in Haiti.”

He also demanded that Hillary Clinton “disclose the audit of all money” related to the Haiti earthquake crisis, as he claimed they scammed the poorest citizens of Haiti out of BILLIONS of dollars through the Clinton Foundation.

“Not even 2% of that money went back to Haiti. So Mr. Trump, we are asking you, begging you, the Haitian community will side with you if one day, you ask Hillary Clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti in 2010 after the earthquake. Haiti is a very poor country. Haiti needs defenders. You said you would champion our cause. We welcome you sir and we will work with you. Ask Hillary Clinton publicly, during your next debate for an audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti.”

politifact2019,"Peace Through Strength and American Pride vs. “Enemy-Centric” PolicyEarlier this week, I spoke at the Freedom Fest in Norfolk, Virginia; and, evidently, the media was asked to leave – not by me, that’s for sure. I want my message out, so despite reporters making up a story about “Palin people kicking us out” (uh, the “Palin people” entourage would consist of one person – my 15-year-old daughter, Willow – and I have no doubt she could take on any reporter, but I know for certain she didn’t “kick ‘em out” of the event). Anyway, here are some of the key issues I spoke about.



DEFENSE SPENDING



It takes a lot of resources to maintain the best fighting force in the world – especially at a time when we face financial uncertainty and a mountain of debt that threatens all of our futures.



We have a federal government that is spending trillions, and that has nationalized whole sections of our economy: the auto industry, the insurance industry, health care, student loans, the list goes on – all of it at enormous cost to the tax payer. The cost of Obamacare alone is likely to exceed $2.5 trillion dollars.



As a result of all these trillion dollar spending bills, America’s going bust in a hurry. By 2020 we may reach debt levels of $20 trillion – twice the debt that we have today! It reminds me of that joke I read the other day: “Please don’t tell Obama what comes after a trillion!”



Something has to be done urgently to stop the out of control Obama-Reid-Pelosi spending machine, and no government agency should be immune from budget scrutiny. We must make sure, however, that we do nothing to undermine the effectiveness of our military. If we lose wars, if we lose the ability to deter adversaries, if we lose the ability to provide security for ourselves and for our allies, we risk losing all that makes America great! That is a price we cannot afford to pay.



This may be obvious to you and me, but I am not sure the Obama Administration gets it. There isn’t a single progressive pet cause which they haven’t been willing to throw billions at. But when it comes to defense spending, all of a sudden they start preaching a message of “fiscal restraint.” Our Defense Secretary recently stated the “gusher” of defense spending was over and that it was time for the Department of Defense to tighten its belt. There’s a gusher of spending alright, but it’s not on defense. Did you know the US actually only ranks 25th worldwide on defense spending as a percentage of GDP? We spend three times more on entitlements and debt services than we do on defense.



Now don’t get me wrong: there’s nothing wrong with preaching fiscal conservatism. I want the federal government to balance its budget right now! And not the Washington way – which is raising your taxes to pay for their irresponsible spending habits. I want it done the American way: by cutting spending, reducing the size of government, and letting people keep more of their hard-earned cash.



But the Obama administration doesn’t practice what it preaches. This is an administration that won’t produce a budget for fear that we discover how reckless they’ve been as fiscal managers. At the same time, it threatens to veto a defense bill because of an extra jet engine!



This administration may be willing to cut defense spending, but it’s increasing it everywhere else. I think we should do it the other way round: cut spending in other departments – apart from defense. We should not be cutting corners on our national security.



THE U.S. NAVY



Secretary Gates recently spoke about the future of the US Navy. He said we have to “ask whether the nation can really afford a Navy that relies on $3 to $6 billion destroyers, $7 billion submarines, and $11 billion carriers.” He went on to ask, “Do we really need... more strike groups for another 30 years when no other country has more than one?”



Well, my answer is pretty simple: Yes, we can and, yes, we do because we must. Our Navy has global responsibilities. It patrols sea lanes and safeguards the freedoms of our allies – and ourselves. The Navy right now only has 286 ships, and that number may decrease. That will limit our options, extend tours for Navy personnel, lessen our ability to secure our allies and deter our adversaries. The Obama administration seems strangely unconcerned about this prospect.



OBAMA’S FOREIGN POLICY INHERITANCE



When George W. Bush came into office, he inherited a military that had been cut deeply, an al Qaeda that had been unchallenged, and an approach to terrorism that focused on bringing court cases rather than destroying those who sought to destroy us. We saw the result of some of that on 9/11.



When President Obama came into office, he inherited a military that was winning in Iraq. He inherited loyal allies and strong alliances. And thanks to the lamestream media pawing and purring over him, he had the benefit of unparalleled global popularity. What an advantage! So their basic foreign policy outlines should have been clear. Commit to the War on Terror. Commit to winning – not ending, but winning the war in Afghanistan. Commit to the fight against violent Islamic extremism wherever it finds sanctuary. Work with our allies. Be resolute with our adversaries. Promote liberty, not least because it enhances our security. Unfortunately, these basic principles seem to have been discarded by Washington.



THE WAR ON TERROR



His administration has banned the phrase “war on terror,” preferring instead politically correct nonsense like “overseas contingency operations.” His Homeland Security Secretary calls acts of terrorism “man-caused disasters.” His reckless plan to close Guantanamo (because there’s no place to go after it’s closed) faces bipartisan opposition now.



The Attorney General just announced that a decision about where to try terrorists like 9/11 master mind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed would not be announced until after the mid-term elections. Is there something he’s afraid to tell us?



The President’s new National Security Strategy does not even use the word “Islamic” when referring to violent extremism. Does he think the ideology of those who seek to kill Americans is irrelevant? How can we seek to defeat an enemy if we don’t acknowledge what motivates them and what their ultimate goals are? President Obama may think he is being politically correct by dropping the term, but it flies in the face of reality. As Senator Joe Lieberman noted, refusing to use the word Islamic when describing the nature of the threat we face is “Orwellian and counterproductive.”



AFGHANISTAN



In Afghanistan, it is true that President Obama approved deploying additional forces to the conflict – most, but not all the troops requested by commanders on the ground. But it took months of indecision to get to that point, and it came at a very high price – a July 2011 date to begin withdrawal.



This date was arbitrary! It bears no relation to conditions on the ground. It sends all the wrong signals to our friends and to our enemies. We know our commanders on the ground are not comfortable with it.



As that great Navy war hero, Senator John McCain recently put it: “The decision to begin withdrawing our forces from Afghanistan arbitrarily in July 2011 seems to be having exactly the effect that many of us predicted it would: It is convincing the key actors inside and outside of Afghanistan that the United States is more interested in leaving than succeeding in this conflict.”



Does the President really believe the Taliban and al Qaeda won’t be empowered by his naming of a starting date for withdrawal? They now believe they can beat him simply by outlasting us. What sort of effect does he think this will have on the morale of our troops – and of our allies?



ALIENATING OUR ALLIES



It’s not the only area where the Obama administration has failed our allies. They escalated a minor zoning issue in Jerusalem into a major dispute with our most important ally in the Middle East, Israel. They treated the Israeli Prime Minister shabbily in Washington. When a Turkish sponsored flotilla threatened to violate a legal Israeli blockade of Hamas-run Gaza, the Obama Administration was silent. When Israeli commandos were assaulted as they sought to prevent unmonitored cargoes from being delivered to Hamas terrorists, the Obama Administration sent signals it might allow a UN investigation into the matter – an investigation that would be sure to condemn our ally Israel and bemoan the plight of Hamas. Loyal NATO allies in central Europe were undermined by the cancellation of a missile defense program with virtually no warning. At the same time, Russia and China are given preferential treatment, while remaining silent on their human rights violations.



CODDLING ADVERSARIES



Meanwhile, the Obama Administration reaches out to some of the world’s worst regimes. They shake hands with dictators like Hugo Chavez, send letters to the Iranian mullahs and envoys to North Korea, ease sanctions on Cuba and talk about doing the same with Burma. That’s when they’re not on one of their worldwide apology tours.



Do we get anything in return for all this bowing and apologizing? No, we don’t. Yes, Russia voted for a weak sanctions resolution on Iran, but it immediately stated it could sell advanced anti-aircraft missile to Iran anyway, and would not end its nuclear cooperation. In response to North Korea’s unprovoked sinking of a South Korean Navy ship, China warned us not to take part in military exercises with our ally.



And while President Obama lets America get pushed around by the likes of Russia and China, our allies are left to wonder about the value of an alliance with the U.S. They have to be wondering if it’s worth it.



AN “ENEMY-CENTRIC” FOREIGN POLICY



It has led one prominent Czech official to call Obama’s foreign policy “enemy-centric.” And this “enemy-centric” approach has real consequences. It not only baffles our allies, it worries them. When coupled with less defense spending, it signals to the world that maybe we can no longer be counted on, and that we have other priorities than being the world leader that keeps the peace and provides security in Europe, in Asia and throughout the world.



Together with this enemy-centric foreign policy, we see a lessening of the long, bipartisan tradition of speaking out for human rights and democracy. The Secretary of State said she would not raise human rights with China because “we pretty much know what they are going to say.” Democracy promotion programs have been cut. Support for the brave Iranians protesting their government was not forthcoming because President Obama would rather try to cut a deal with their oppressors.



When the world’s dictators see the United States unconcerned with human rights and political freedom, they breathe a sigh of relief, because they know they have a free hand to repress their own people.



This goes against the very ideals on which our republic was founded. There is a long bipartisan tradition of speaking out in favor of freedom – from FDR to Ronald Reagan. America loses something very important when its President consigns human rights and freedom to the back burner of its international priorities.



A DIFFERENT VIEW OF AMERICA



We have a President, perhaps for the very first time since the founding of our republic, who doesn’t appear to believe that America is the greatest earthly force for good the world has ever known.



When asked whether he believed in American exceptionalism, President Obama answered, “I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism.” Amazing. Amazing.



I think this statement speaks volumes about his world view. He sees nothing unique in the American experience? Really? Our founding, and our founding mothers and fathers? Really? And our history over the past two and half centuries?



Really? He sees nothing unique in an America that fought and won two world wars and in victory sought not one inch of territory or one dollar of plunder? He sees nothing unique in an America that, though exhausted by conflict, still laid the foundation for security in Europe and Asia after World War II? He sees nothing unique in an America that prevailed against an evil ideology in the Cold War? Does he just see a country that has to be apologized for around the world, especially to dictators?



President Obama actually seems reluctant to even embrace American power. Earlier this year when he was asked about his faltering Middle East peace process, he said “whether we like it or not, we remain a dominant military superpower.” Whether we like it or not?! Really? Mr. President, this may come as news to you, but most Americans actually do like it. And so do our allies. They know it was our military might that liberated countless millions from tyranny, slavery, and oppression over the last 234 years. Yes, we do like it. As a dominant superpower, the United States has won wars hot and cold; our military has advanced the cause of freedom and kept authoritarian powers in check.



It is in America’s and the world’s best interests for our country to remain the dominant military superpower, but under President Obama’s leadership that dominance may be slipping away. It’s the result of an agenda that reeks of complacency and defeatism.



(I went on from there to talk about our need to end the negative, defeatist attitudes of those in leadership. I spoke further on American exceptionalism, and Willow and I ended a great evening with some great patriots. Sorry the media chose to report anything other than what actually happened at the event.)

Washington, D.C.

12:03 P.M. EDT

MR. HARWOOD: Good afternoon from Washington, D.C. I'm John Harwood. It is noon on the East Coast. The Dow Jones average stands around 10,700 points; 15 million Americans are out of work. And we're spending the next hour talking about how to fix the troubled American economy.

Please welcome the President of the United States. (Applause.)

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.

MR. HARWOOD: Mr. President, thanks for being here.

THE PRESIDENT: That was quite a lead-in, by the way. (Laughter.)

MR. HARWOOD: Yes, wasn’t it? You like that dramatic pause? (Laughter.) We have got a cross-section of people from around the country -- CEOs, union workers, teachers and students --

THE PRESIDENT: It’s a good-looking group, I have to say. (Laughter and applause.)

MR. HARWOOD: -- small business owners, people who don't have a job. Every one of them has a stake in the American Dream. And they got some good news over the weekend. The National Bureau of Economic Research, as you know, has said that the recession ended in June 2009 -- a few months after you took office. And yet here’s the problem you find yourself with. Many leaders in business think you and your policies are hostile to them. And many ordinary Americans think your policies are helping Wall Street and big business. How did that happen?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, even though economists may say that the recession officially ended last year, obviously for the millions of people who are still out of work, people who have seen their home values decline, people who are struggling to pay the bills day to day, it’s still very real for them.

And I think we have to go back to what was happening when I was first sworn in as the 44th President of the United States. We went through the worst recession since the Great Depression. Nothing has come close. In fact, if you look at the consequences of the recession in the ‘80s, the recession in the ‘90s, and the recession in 2001, and you combine all three of those, it still wasn’t as bad as this recession that we went through.

So the month I was sworn in we lost 750,000 jobs; the month after that 600,000; the month after that 600,000. This is before any of our plans had a chance to take effect. The financial markets were on the verge of meltdown and the economy was contracting about 6 percent -- by far, the largest contraction we've seen since the ‘30s.

You combine all that and what that meant was that we had to take some steps very quickly just to make sure that the financial system was not collapsing -- that people could get auto loans, could get student loans, that businesses large and small could get some financing to keep their doors open and to keep their payrolls on track. And in addition, we had to make sure that we didn’t slip into a Great Depression.

Now, we've done that. Those programs that we put in place worked. So now you’ve got a financial system that is stable. It’s still not as strong as it was back in 2006, 2007, but it is stabilized. You’ve got now eight consecutive months of private sector job growth. Businesses are able to borrow again; they’re investing again; they’re making profits again.

That's all the good news. The challenge is, is that the hole was so deep that a lot of people out there are still hurting -- and probably some folks here in the audience are still having a tough time. (Applause.) And so the question then becomes what can we now put in place to make sure that the trend lines continue in a positive direction, as opposed to going back in the negative direction.

Last week we got some good news. After fighting for several months, we finally got a small business tax cut bill in place so that we’re eliminating capital gains for small businesses and startups, making sure that they can get loans -- because small businesses are the ones that have been hardest hit in terms of not being able to get capital. We have put forward proposals, for example, to accelerate investment here in the United States instead of overseas in research and development and plants and equipment that could put people back to work.

So there are a lot of plans in place that can make improvement, but it’s slow and steady, as opposed to the kind of quick fix that I think a lot of people would like to see. But the thing I’ve just got to remind people of is the fact that it took us a decade to get into the problem that we’re in right now.

The Wall Street Journal came out with a report based on Census information that the years from 2001 to 2009, the middle class actually saw their wages decline by 5 percent. This was before the financial crisis. So these have been some long-term trends of the middle class having a lot of problems out there. And what we’ve got to do now it to reverse it, but something that took 10 years to create is going to take a little more time to solve.

MR. HARWOOD: I’ve heard you give that turnaround message you just gave many times.

THE PRESIDENT: Right, right.

MR. HARWOOD: Let me ask about your assessment of the challenge and the problem in communicating that to the American people. We all identify with people like ourselves. Do you think it’s possible that because of your style, or the unusual things about your background -- your racial heritage, where you grew up, Ivy League education -- that the fearful voters who are about to go to the polls in November think, yes, I hear him, he may get it intellectually, but he doesn’t feel what I’m feeling?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, here’s my suspicion. I think that when the unemployment rate is still high and people are having a tough time, it doesn’t matter if I was green -- (laughter) -- it doesn’t matter if I was purple. I think people would still be frustrated, and understandably so.

Look, I can describe what’s happening to the economy overall, but if you’re out of work right now, the only thing that you’re going to be hearing is, when do I get a job? (Applause.) If you’re about to lose your home, all you’re thinking about is, when can I get my home?

So I don’t think that those are the issues. And by the way, I think most people understand -- because I spent two years running around the country talking about my life and why I was running for President -- they understand that I was the kid of a single mom, and I got my education through scholarships, and I lived in a small apartment with my grandparents, and they were helped by the G.I. Bill and FHA in terms of being able to climb into the middle class.

The whole reason I ran was because my life is a testimony to the American Dream. And everything that we’ve been doing since I came into office is designed to make sure that that American Dream continues for future generations.

I think the challenge right now is that I’m thinking about the next generation and there are a lot of folks out there who are thinking about the next election. If I were making decisions based on November, then I wouldn’t have done some of the things that I did because I knew they weren’t popular. But they were the right thing to do. And that's got to be my top priority. (Applause.)

MR. HARWOOD: Let’s go to the real jury who will decide whether they were the right things to do with an audience question right here.

Q Thank you very much and, quite frankly, good afternoon, President Obama. I am deeply honored to finally be in this forum, and so grateful for CNBC making the forum available so that you can speak to American citizens just like myself.

THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you.

Q I am a chief financial officer for a veterans service organization, AmVets here in Washington. I’m also a mother, I’m a wife, I’m an American veteran, and I’m one of your middle-class Americans. And quite frankly, I’m exhausted. I’m exhausted of defending you, defending your administration, defending the mantle of change that I voted for --

THE PRESIDENT: Right.

Q -- and deeply disappointed with where we are right now.

I have been told that I voted for a man who said he was going to change things in a meaningful way for the middle class. I’m one of those people, and I’m waiting, sir. I’m waiting. I don't feel it yet. And I thought, while it wouldn’t be in great measure, I would feel it in some small measure.

I have two children in private school. And the financial recession has taken an enormous toll on my family. My husband and I joked for years that we thought we were well beyond the hot dogs and beans era of our lives.

THE PRESIDENT: Right.

Q But quite frankly, it’s starting to knock on our door and ring true that that might be where we’re headed again. And quite frankly, Mr. President, I need you to answer this honestly, is this my new reality?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I think that you describe exactly what is the bedrock of America -- a veteran who’s working for veterans, somebody who is a CFO and I am sure knows how to manage their money, have made good decisions.

Q Sometimes. (Laughter.)

THE PRESIDENT: I’m not saying once in a while you don't want to get a new pair of shoes. (Laughter.)

Q Today. (Laughter.)

THE PRESIDENT: So the life you describe -- one of responsibility, looking after your family, contributing back to your community -- that's what we want to reward.

Now, as I said before, times are tough for everybody right now, so I understand your frustration. But I would just -- when you say there are things that you’d like to see happen or you’re hoping to see happen that haven’t happened yet, let me just give you a couple of examples.

I right now have two children -- it sounds like you’ve got kids, as well.

Q Two girls.

THE PRESIDENT: Two girls. You’re going to be thinking about college soon.

Q Next year.

THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Now part of what we did over the last year and a half is to make sure that billions of dollars that were going to subsidize financial service industries under the federal student loan programs are now going to be going directly to students so that millions more students are going to be able to get loans and grants and scholarships to go to college. Now, that's going to have an impact on a whole bunch of kids out there, including maybe yours.

If you have a credit card, which I assume, you do --

Q No.

THE PRESIDENT: Well, see, now you’re really -- now you’ve shown how responsible you are. (Laughter.) But if you have a mortgage or a credit card or any kind of financial dealings out there, as a consequence of the changes we made, the credit card companies can’t increase your interest rate without notifying you, and they can’t increase your interest rate on your previous balances. In terms of getting a mortgage, they -- you can’t have a mortgage broker steer you to a mortgage that ultimately is going to cost you more money, because maybe they’re getting a financial incentive to do so. Those things are now against the law. So there are a whole host of protections in there.

You are a parent who has children -- if your child, heaven forbid, had a preexisting condition, before I took office, you were out of luck in terms of being able to get health insurance for that child. Now, insurance companies have to give you health insurance for that child, and by the way, that health insurance can’t drop you if you get sick.

So there are a whole host of things that we’ve put in place that do make your life better. But the bottom line is if your 401(K) is still down substantially from where it was a while back, if you haven’t seen a raise in a long time, if your home value went down --

Q Keep going. (Laughter.)

THE PRESIDENT: -- depending on where you live, all those things still make you feel like, gosh, I’m treading water.

Q Still struggling -- that's right.

THE PRESIDENT: And so my goal here is not to try to convince you that everything is where it needs to be. It’s not. That's why I ran for President. But what I am saying is, is that we’re moving in the right direction. And if we are able to keep our eye on our long-term goal -- which is making sure that every family out there, if they’re middle class, that they can pay their bills, have the security of health insurance, retire with dignity and respect, send their kids to college; if they’re not yet in the middle class, that there are ladders there to get into the middle class, if people work hard and get an education to apply themselves -- that's our goal. That's the America we believe in. And I think that we are on track to be able to do that.

MR. HARWOOD: Mr. President, let me go at this from a different direction, from the direction of psychology, business confidence. You just mentioned things that credit card companies and health insurance companies used to do. There are some people in business who think, to use a phrase that you used recently about your critics, who think you talk about them like dogs. Let’s listen to Ken Langone, a billionaire businessman.

THE PRESIDENT: I’m sorry, billionaire businessman?

MR. HARWOOD: Yes.

THE PRESIDENT: Okay.

(Video is shown.)

MR. LANGONE: What should they stop doing? Well, I think the one thing to do is to not make people in business feel like we’re villains or criminals or doing something wrong. I think anytime we can create a job that puts somebody to work, the country is better served. So I think that there’s got to be a need to understand that America, our democracy, is based on a strong, vibrant private economy.

MR. HARWOOD: Are you vilifying business?

THE PRESIDENT: Absolutely not. Look, let’s look at the track record here. When I came into office, businesses, some of the same commentators who are on CNBC, were crying, “Do something,” -- because as a consequence of reckless decisions that had been made, the economy was on the verge of collapse. Those same businesses now are profitable. The financial markets are stabilized. We haven’t increased taxes on businesses. Actually, we have instituted about 50 tax cuts, many of them going to businesses large and small.

And so the only thing that we’ve said is that we’ve got to make sure that we’re not doing some of the same things that we were doing in the past that got us into this mess in the first place.

So when I mentioned, for example, changes in the financial services industry, it is very important for us not to find ourselves in a position in which banks get too big to fail, and if they make bad decisions taxpayers have to bail them out or we let the entire economy collapse. That’s not a choice that I want any future President to have to make. And we instituted those changes.

And the fact is that when FDR put in place deposit insurance in banks, banks said at the time, this is going to destroy capitalism. When Medicare was instituted, there were a whole bunch of people who said, this is socialized medicine. Now we take it for granted. But oftentimes there’s this response that somehow these modest reforms that make the free market work better for consumers and for workers as well as for businesses, on the front end are resisted.

MR. HARWOOD: Let me take it, though, to a level that's beyond policy and it goes to what you value and you don't value.

THE PRESIDENT: Sure.

MR. HARWOOD: I think some of those in business may think that deep down you think that working for profit is morally inferior to the kind of work you used to do as a community organizer. Is that how you feel?

THE PRESIDENT: No, it isn’t. Look, in every speech, every interview that I've made, I've constantly said that what sets America apart, what has made us successful over the long term, is we've got the most dynamic free market economy in the world. And that has to be preserved. That has to be preserved. We benefit from entrepreneurs and innovators who are going out there and creating jobs, creating businesses.

Government can't create the majority of jobs. And in fact, we want to get out of the way of folks who’ve got a great idea and want to run with it and are going to be putting people to work.

MR. HARWOOD: Maybe we've got one of those people right here.

THE PRESIDENT: I'd love to hear from him.

Q Thank you, Mr. President. I'm 30 years old. I recently graduated from law school. And I went back to law school in order to pursue a life of public service, like you have. And what I found was that I simply -- there aren't jobs out there right now. I took advantage of the loans that you were just speaking about, but I can't make the interest payments on those loans today, let alone think about getting a mortgage, having a family, having even a marriage -- it’s awfully expensive. (Laughter.)

THE PRESIDENT: I'm not going to comment on that. (Laughter and applause.) Let me just say that whatever the expense, it’s worth it. (Laughter.) I want that on record. (Applause.)

Q Like a lot of people in my generation, I was really inspired by you and by your campaign and message that you brought, and that inspiration is dying away. It feels like the American Dream is not attainable to a lot of us. And what I'm really hoping to hear from you is several concrete steps that you’re going to take moving forward that will be able to re-ignite my generation, re-ignite the youth who are beset by student loans. And I really want to know, is the American Dream dead for me?

THE PRESIDENT: Absolutely not. Look, we still have the best universities in the world. We’ve got the most dynamic private sector in the world. We’ve got the most productive workers in the world. There is not a country in the world that would not want to change places with us. For all the problems that we’ve got, as tough as things are right now, we are still the country that billions of people around the world look to and aspire to. And I want everybody to always remember that.

Now, as I said before, what we saw happening during 2001 to the time I took office was wages actually declining for middle-class families, people treading water, young people having more trouble getting their foot in the door in terms of businesses. And so we are now having to go back to the fundamentals that made America great.

And that means we’ve got to improve our education system. That means that we have to make sure that our markets are working in a way that is good for a broad base of people and not just a narrow base of people. It means that, let’s say -- you used the example of student loans -- one of the things that I just mentioned was, is that we put billions of dollars more into student loans. This was paid for, now. We took this out of financial service industries that were getting essentially unjustified subsidies -- they’re now going to students so that your debt would be lower. And by the way, part of that law also capped your debt at 10 percent of your income so that you knew that you could actually afford to take out this debt and pay for it even if you had a modest salary.



So we are taking these steps. But the most important thing we can do right now is to grow our economy. That’s the single most important thing that we can do. And some of the measures that we’ve put forward and I’m going to be fighting for are designed to exactly do that.

For example, we’ve said let’s accelerate business investment in the year 2011 to give a further jumpstart to the economy. That’s something that, by the way, doesn’t add to the deficit necessarily long term because this is depreciation that could be taken in the out-years. We’re just saying you invest now, you can take it now. And that gives businesses incentives to do it.

We want to give tax breaks to companies that are investing in research and development here in the United States because the key to our long-term growth is technology and innovation. And if we can get more of those investments here, that's going to improve. The reforms we’ve made on education -- which, by the way, have received bipartisan support -- are designed to make sure we’ve got the best engineers and the best scientists in the world right here in the United States.

So if we’re doing all those things, I am confident that the American Dream will continue for the next generation. What we can’t do, though, is go back to the same old things that we were doing, because we’ve been putting off these problems for decades. And that is something that I refuse to do.

MR. HARWOOD: Mr. President, let me ask you a question about course correction. Sometimes a leader, even if you think you’ve done the right things, but if the people you’re trying to lead don't think so, you’ve got to somehow accommodate that, just like you would in a relationship. He was talking about marriage. (Laughter.)

As you go forward, is there any way in which you want to signal to the American people that you’re going to change your approach? And specifically -- we’re coming up to the midterm election -- have you asked your Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and your top economic advisor Larry Summers to stay with you through the end of your term, or might you make some changes?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I have not made any determinations about personnel. I think Larry Summers and Tim Geithner have done an outstanding job, as have my whole economic team. This is tough, the work that they do. They’ve been at it for two years, and they’re going to have a whole range of decisions about family that will factor into this, as well. But the bottom line is, is that we’re constantly thinking, is what we’re doing working as well as it could? Do we have other options and other alternatives that we can explore?

I think one of the things that's on a lot of people’s minds right now, obviously, for example, is the issue of deficits and debt. That has fanned a lot of people’s concerns because we had to take a lot of emergency decisions last year that cost money. Now, they were the right things to do. Had we not taken them, the economy would be in a much worse position. Even John McCain’s former economist during the campaign has said that if we hadn’t taken these steps, that we might have lost another 8 million jobs, and we would be in an even deeper hole.

MR. HARWOOD: And we know you have that commission that reports in December, but I think a lot of Americans may wonder how serious you are about what that commission is going to do.

THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me tell you. We’ve already identified $250 billion in cuts on the discretionary side of our budget. We’ve identified $300 billion worth of loopholes in our tax code that are not helping economic growth. If we just did those two things, as I’ve already proposed, that would make a huge difference. We’ve proposed to freeze discretionary spending for three years, to start whittling down some of the debt that I inherited.

MR. HARWOOD: Peter Orszag, as you know, your former budget director, says that we can’t afford to extend the Bush tax cuts for anyone after a year or two. Is he right?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I want to make sure I get this gentleman’s question in, but I will say this. The debate that we’re having about tax cuts right now I think really speaks to the choices that everybody here is going to be facing as we go forward. I think all of us are concerned about the deficit; all of us are concerned about the debt. Now, what we’ve said is that we should extend tax cuts, tax relief, for middle-class Americans -- like most of the audience here -- because, first of all, you’re the ones who didn't see your wages or income rise. Second of all, you’re the folks who are most likely to spend it on a new computer for your kids, or in some other fashion that would boost demand in the economy.

Everybody agrees that this should be done. All we’ve said is that you get those tax breaks up to $250,000 a year. After that, if you make more than $250,000 a year, you still get a tax break; it’s just you only get it up to $250,000 --

MR. HARWOOD: House Speak Pelosi said last week --

THE PRESIDENT: And let me say this, John, because I just think it’s very important that everybody understands this. What the Republicans are proposing is that we, in addition to that, provide tax relief to primarily millionaires and billionaires. It would cost us $700 billion to do it. On average, millionaires would get a check of $100,000.

And by the way, I would be helped by this, so I just want to be clear. I’m speaking against my own financial interests. This is a -- it is a irresponsible thing for us to do. Those folks are the least likely to spend it and -- (applause.)

MR. HARWOOD: Well, let me ask you from this angle. House Speaker Pelosi last week said you can get 80 percent of the revenue if you simply take away the tax cuts for people over a million dollars. Are you open to any sort of compromise that would capture most of that revenue, but those people between $250,000 and a million would get to keep that tax cut?

THE PRESIDENT: Here’s the basic principle. Here’s what I can’t do as President. I think I’ve worked pretty hard and I have a pretty big grasp of the challenges that we’re facing. (Applause.) But here’s what I can’t do. I can’t give tax cuts to the top 2 percent of Americans, 86 percent of that money going to people making a million dollars or more, and lower the deficit at the same time. I don’t have the math.

I would love to do it. Every -- anybody in elected office would love nothing more than to give everybody tax cuts, not cut services, make sure that I’m providing help to student loans, make sure that we’re keeping our roads safe and our bridges safe, and make sure that we’re paying for our veterans who are coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. At some point, the numbers just don’t work.

So what I’ve said is very simple. Let’s go ahead and move forward on what we agree to, which is tax relief for 95 -- 97 percent of Americans. In fact, actually everybody would get tax relief, but just up to $250,000 a year more. And let’s get the economy moving faster, let’s get it growing faster. At some point in the future, if we want to have discussions about further lowering tax rates, let’s do so at a time when we can actually afford it.

MR. HARWOOD: All right, we’ve kept this gentleman waiting long enough.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.

Q Mr. President, it is an honor to be in front of you. I am a small business owner. I'm a third-generation business owner in Pennsylvania. We are actually celebrating our 100th-year anniversary because we were founded in 1910.

THE PRESIDENT: Congratulations. (Applause.) What’s your business?

Q Something called Susquehanna Glass, and we do monogrammed glasswork.



THE PRESIDENT: Outstanding.

Q If you ever pick up a Williams-Sonoma catalog and buy a monogrammed glass, you’re getting the stuff from me. (Laughter.)

THE PRESIDENT: Congratulations -- and your grandfather started this?

Q My grandfather and his brother started the business, yes, three generations.

THE PRESIDENT: That’s outstanding. That’s great.

Q Two world wars, one Great Depression, and a lot of economic recession, so we’ve been through a lot. What I have learned in running a small business over that period of time is that to succeed, to survive, you have to reinvest in your business. It simply is imperative. The single greatest economic challenge that I face today is a public that is fearful and negative.

You, when you first came into office, your stimulus package actually funded a very ailing financial system, which was essential for small businesspeople. You turned around and invested in the auto industry, and I believe saved millions of jobs, and I think you’re actually going to make a profit on them. (Applause.)

THE PRESIDENT: We are. That's true.

Q And yet your critics continue to paint you as a dramatically anti-business President. I believe you are investing in this country, as small businesses invest. And yet for some reason the public just doesn’t get it. I need you to help us understand how you can regain the political center, because you’re losing the war of sound bites, you’re losing the media cycles.

I have a son that just graduated from college. He was just commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army. He wants to make a career of the Army. I want to have a business for him to come back to when he gets out of the Army.

THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, let me say to your son thank you for your service to our country, and we want to make sure we’ve got a strong economy for him to come back to. (Applause.)

As I said before, I think that if you look at what we’ve done over the last two years, it’s very hard to find evidence of anything that we’ve done that is designed to squash business as opposed to promote business.

You mentioned the auto industry. This is a great example of something that we did -- we knew it wasn’t popular. I mean, people just -- the last thing folks wanted to see was us helping the auto industry. Now, keep in mind, the previous administration had been helping them, giving them billions of dollars and just asking nothing in return. But we were at a point where two of the big three automakers were about to liquidate, in the midst of this huge recession, and we would have lost an additional million jobs as a consequence, but also lost what is a signature manufacturing industry in this country. I mean, we built the world auto industry.

And so what we did was we said to the auto companies, we are going to help you, but you’ve got to make some changes. You’ve got to make sure that we see a restructuring of how you do business. And by the way, some of the folks who made the biggest concessions were actually the workers there. It wasn’t -- they took huge cuts in terms of pay and benefits because they understood that there wage structures could no longer support the auto industry in a competitive era.

We are now seeing the top -- the three U.S. automakers making a profit for the first time in a long time. They are hiring for the first time in a long time. And that has huge ramifications, because there are suppliers, and the restaurant next to the plant that's open -- and so it has provided a lot of confidence in a lot of these communities. But it wasn’t popular at the time.

Now, there were some folks in -- on CNBC who were unhappy with our decision, partly because they had made bets, essentially, against the auto industry, or they had senior debt. And we said, you know what, if the workers are giving up something, if management is giving up something, if the federal government is giving up something, and taxpayers are giving something, you’re not going to get a hundred percent of what you bargained for in terms of some of the investments that you made here. You’re going to have to take a haircut, too. And they got very mad about it. I still remember some of the fulminating that was taking place on CNBC about it. (Laughter.)

We didn’t do that because we were anti-business. We were doing it because we wanted to make sure that these businesses would continue. And by the way, some of the same folks who complained were some of the same folks who, if we hadn’t taken some of those actions on Wall Street, would have lost everything they had. And they didn’t mind us intervening when it was helping them. But they did mind it when we were helping some other folks.

So the point, I guess, I’m making is this. I think that American businesses like yours are what make this country go. We have passed eight tax cuts for small businesses so far. We have made it easier for you to invest in plants and equipment. We have already taken down your capital gains and we want to reduce capital gains for small businesses down to zero. All of these things are what historically have been considered pro-business agendas.

Even on health care, a lot of small businesses couldn’t provide health care. We are now saying we’ve giving you a tax break if you provide health care to your workers. And 4 million small businesses out there are in a position to potentially take advantage of it.

But what is absolutely true -- and this goes to the point you were making earlier, John, about midcourse corrections -- the rhetoric and the politicizing of so many decisions that are out there has to be toned down. We’ve got to get back to working together. And my hope is -- and this is part of my job as leader. It’s not just a matter of implementing good policies, but also setting a better tone so that everybody feels like we can start cooperating again, instead of going at loggerheads all the time. (Applause.) And I’m going to have to do more additional outreach to business community on that front.

MR. HARWOOD: You mentioned fulminating. One of my colleagues, Rick Santelli, was one of those who complained about your policies early -- ",0
politifact12721,"Updated: The Facts About Hillary Clinton’s EmailsFactsheets

Updated: The Facts About Hillary Clinton’s Emails

We’ve put all of the information about Hillary Clinton’s State Department emails here. Just the facts, all in one place.

Why did Clinton use her own email account?

When Clinton got to the Department, she opted to use her personal email account as a matter of convenience. It enabled her to reach people quickly and keep in regular touch with her family and friends more easily given her travel schedule.

That is the only reason she used her own account.

Her usage was widely known to the over 100 State Department and U.S. government colleagues she emailed, consistent with the practice of prior Secretaries of State and permitted at the time.

As Clinton has said, in hindsight, it would have been better to just have two accounts. While she thought using one account would be easier, obviously, that has not been the case.

Was it allowed?

Yes. The laws, regulations, and State Department policy in place during her tenure permitted her to use a non-government email for work.

The 2009 National Archives regulation in place during her tenure required that ""[a]gencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system."" The regulation recognizes the use of non-government email accounts.

As she has stated, Clinton's practice was to email government officials on their "".gov"" accounts, so her work emails were immediately captured and preserved. In fact, more than 90% of those emails should have already been captured in the State Department’s email system before she provided them with paper copies.

A Politifact analysis also confirmed that Clinton's practices complied with laws and regulations, including support from the former director of a prominent government accountability organization: ""In Clinton's defense, we should note that it was only after Clinton left the State Department, that the National Archives issued a recommendation that government employees should avoid conducting official business on personal emails (though they noted there might be extenuating circumstances such as an emergency that require it). Additionally, in 2014, President Barack Obama signed changes to the Federal Records Act that explicitly said federal officials can only use personal email addresses if they also copy or send the emails to their official account. Because these rules weren't in effect when Clinton was in office, 'she was in compliance with the laws and regulations at the time,' said Gary Bass, founder and former director of OMB Watch, a government accountability organization.""

Clinton said she did not use her email to send or receive classified information, but the State Department and two Inspectors General said some of these emails do contain classified information. Was her statement inaccurate?

Clinton only used her account for unclassified email. No information in Clinton's emails was marked classified at the time she sent or received them.

When information is reviewed for public release, it is common for information previously unclassified to be upgraded to classified if the State Department or another agency believes its public release could cause potential harm to national security, law enforcement or diplomatic relations.

After reviewing a sampling of the 55,000 pages of emails, the Inspectors General have proffered that a small number of emails, which did not contain any classified markings and/or dissemination controls, should have been classified at the time they were sent. The State Department has said it disagrees with this assessment.

Clinton hopes the State Department and the agencies involved in the review process will sort out as quickly as possible which of the 55,000 pages of emails are appropriate to share with the public.

How did Clinton receive and consume classified information?

The Secretary's office was located in a secure area. Classified information was viewed in hard copy by Clinton while in the office. While on travel, the State Department had rigorous protocols for her and traveling staff to receive and transmit information of all types.

A separate, closed email system was used by the State Department for the purpose of handling classified communications, which was designed to prevent such information from being transmitted anywhere other than within that system.

Is Department of Justice conducting a criminal inquiry into Clinton’s email use?

No. As the Department of Justice and Inspectors General made clear, the IGs made a security referral. This was not criminal in nature as misreported by some in the press. The Department of Justice is now seeking assurances about the storage of materials related to Clinton’s email account.

Is it true that her email server and a thumb drive were recently turned over to the government? Why?

Again, when information is reviewed for public release, it is common for information previously unclassified to be upgraded to classified if the State Department or another agency believes its public release could cause potential harm to national security, law enforcement or diplomatic relations.

Clinton hopes that State and the other agencies involved in the review process will sort out as quickly as possible which emails are appropriate to share with the public, and that the release will be as timely and as transparent as possible.

When the Department upgraded some of the previously unclassified email to classified, her team worked with the State Department to ensure copies of her emails were stored in a safe and secure manner. She also directed her team to give her server that hosted her email account while she was Secretary to the Department of Justice, as well as a thumb drive containing copies of her emails that already had been provided to the State Department. Clinton has pledged to cooperate with the government's security inquiry.

Would this issue not have arisen if she used a state.gov email address?

Even if Clinton's emails had been on a government email address and government device, these questions would be raised prior to public release.

While the State Department's review of her 55,000 emails brought the issue to the Inspectors Generals' attentions, the emails that recently were upgraded to classified prior to public release were on the unclassified .gov email system. They were not on the separate, closed system used by State Department for handling classified communications.

Have Clinton's State Department aides also been asked to provide the Department and Congress with emails from their personal accounts?

We understand that members of her State Department staff were recently asked to assist the Department in its record-keeping by providing any work-related emails they may have on personal accounts. They have received requests from Rep. Gowdy as well.

Clinton is proud of the work of all the dedicated public servants that were part of her team at the State Department. She was proud of her aides then and is proud of them now, as they have committed - as she has - to being as helpful as possible in responding to requests.

Press reports say she used multiple devices – a Blackberry and an iPad – is that true?

Clinton relied on her Blackberry for emailing. This was easiest for her. When the iPad came out in 2010, she was as curious as others and found it great for shopping, browsing, and reading articles when she traveled. She also had access to her email account on her iPad and sometimes used it for that too.

Was she ever provided guidance about her use of a non-"".gov"" email account?

The State Department has and did provide guidance regarding the need to preserve federal records. To address these requirements, it was her practice to email government employees on their "".gov"" email address. That way, work emails would be immediately captured and preserved in government record-keeping systems.

What did Clinton provide to the State Department?

On December 5, 2014, 30,490 copies of work or potentially work-related emails sent and received by Clinton from March 18, 2009, to February 1, 2013, were provided to the State Department. This totaled roughly 55,000 pages. More than 90% of her work or potentially work-related emails provided to the Department were already in the State Department's record-keeping system because those e-mails were sent to or received by ""state.gov"" accounts.

Early in her term, Clinton continued using an att.blackberry.net account that she had used during her Senate service. Given her practice from the beginning of emailing State Department officials on their state.gov accounts, her work-related emails during these initial weeks would have been captured and preserved in the State Department's record-keeping system. She, however, no longer had access to these emails once she transitioned from this account.

Why did the Select Committee announce that she used multiple email addresses during her tenure?

In fairness to the Committee, this was an honest misunderstanding. Clinton used one email account during her tenure at State (with the exception of her initial weeks in office while transitioning from an email account she had previously used). In March 2013, a month after she left the Department, Gawker published the email address she used while Secretary, and so she had to change the address on her account.

At the time the printed copies were provided to the Department in 2014, because it was the same account, the new email address established after she left office appeared on the printed copies as the sender, and not the address she used as Secretary. In fact, this address on the account did not exist until March 2013. This led to understandable confusion that was cleared up directly with the Committee after its press conference.

Why didn't Clinton provide her emails to the State Department until December 2014?

In 2014, after recognizing potential gaps in its overall recordkeeping system, the State Department asked for the help of the four previous former Secretaries in meeting the State Department's obligations under the Federal Records Act.

Clinton responded to this request by providing the State Department with over 55,000 pages of emails. As it was Clinton's practice to email U.S. government officials on their .gov accounts, the overwhelming majority of these emails should have already been preserved in the State Department’s email system.

In providing these emails to the Department, Clinton included all she had that were even potentially work-related—including emails about using a fax machine or asking for iced tea during a meeting—erring on the side of over-inclusion, as confirmed by the Department and National Archives' determination that over 1250 emails were ""personal"" records (which they have indicated will be returned to her).

After providing her work and potentially work-related emails, she chose not to keep her personal, non-work related emails, which by definition, are not federal records and were not requested by the Department or anyone else.

Why did the State Department ask for assistance in collecting records? Why did the State Department need assistance in further meeting its requirements under the Federal Records Act?

The State Department formally requested the assistance of the four previous former Secretaries in a letter to their representatives dated October 28, 2014, to help in further meeting the Department’s requirements under the Federal Records Act.

The letter stated that in September 2013, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) issued new guidance clarifying records management responsibilities regarding the use of personal email accounts for government business.

While this guidance was issued after all four former Secretaries had departed office, the Department decided to ensure its records were as complete as possible and sought copies of work emails sent or received by the Secretaries on their own accounts.

Why did Clinton decide not to keep her personal emails?

As Clinton has said before, these were private, personal messages, including emails about her daughter's wedding plans, her mother's funeral services and condolence notes, as well as emails on family vacations, yoga routines, and other items one would typically find in their own email account, such as offers from retailers, spam, etc.

Did Clinton delete any emails while facing a subpoena?

No. As noted, the emails that Clinton chose not to keep were personal emails—they were not federal records or even work-related—and therefore were not subject to any preservation obligation under the Federal Records Act or any request. Nor would they have been subject to the subpoena—which did not exist at the time—that was issued by the Benghazi Select Committee some three months later.

Rep. Gowdy's subpoena issued in March 2015 did not seek, and had nothing to do with, her personal, non-work emails nor her server nor the request by State Department last year for her help in their own record-keeping. Indeed in his March 19th letter, Rep. Gowdy expressly stated he was not seeking any emails that were ""purely personal in nature.""

In March 2015, when Rep. Gowdy issued a subpoena to Clinton, the State Department had received all of Clinton's work-related emails in response to their 2014 request, and indeed, had already provided Clinton's relevant emails to Rep. Gowdy’s committee.

Rep. Gowdy, other Republicans, and some members of the media have seized on a CNN interview with Clinton to question her on this point. Rep. Gowdy has even gone so far as to say Clinton is lying. But he and the others are clearly mistaken.

As Vox reported, ""[S]he didn't lie about the subpoena. … Clinton clearly wasn't responding to the question of whether she'd ever been subpoenaed by the Benghazi Committee but whether she'd been subpoenaed before she wiped the emails from her server."" Additionally, Factcheck.org said in its analysis, ""Clinton's denial came in response to a question about deleting emails 'while facing a subpoena,' and Clinton objected to Keilar's 'assumption.' Clinton’s campaign said that the emails were deleted before she received the subpoena and that was the point Clinton was making."" Politifact added, ""Suggesting that Clinton deleted emails while facing a subpoena contradicts what we know about the controversy so far.""

Vox went on to further decry Rep. Gowdy's reaction, saying, ""[T]his one's a particularly absurd gimmick, even for a committee that is selectively leaking from depositions and documents to justify its existence. If there was a more extreme category of dissembling than 'pants on fire,' now would be the time for Politifact to roll it out on the House Republicans.""

Why was the State Department given printed copies?

That is the requirement. The instructions regarding electronic mail in the Foreign Affairs Manual (the Department's policy manual) require that ""until technology allowing archival capabilities for long-term electronic storage and retrieval of email messages is available and installed, those messages warranting preservation as records (for periods longer than current E-mail systems routinely maintain them) must be printed out and filed with related records."" [5 FAM 443.3].

Were any work items deleted in the course of producing the printed copies?

No.

How many emails were in her account? And how many of those were provided to the State Department?

Her email account contained a total of 62,320 sent and received emails from March 2009 to February 2013. Based on the review process described below, 30,490 of these emails were provided to the Department, and the remaining 31,830 were private, personal records.

How and who decided what should be provided to the State Department?

The Federal Records Act puts the obligation on the government official to determine what is and is not a federal record. The State Department Foreign Affairs Manual outlines guidance ""designed to help employees determine which of their e-mail messages must be preserved as federal records and which may be deleted without further authorization because they are not Federal record materials."" [5 FAM 443.1(c)].

Following conversations with State Department officials and in response to the State Department's 2014 letter to former Secretaries, Clinton directed her attorneys to assist by identifying and preserving all emails that could potentially be federal records. This entailed a multi-step process to review each email and provide printed copies of Clinton's emails to the State Department, erring on the side of including anything that might be even potentially work-related.

A search was conducted on Clinton's email account for all emails sent and received from 2009 to her last day in office, February 1, 2013.

After this universe was determined, a search was conducted for a "".gov"" (not just state.gov) in any address field in an email. This produced over 27,500 emails, representing more than 90% of the 30,490 printed copies that were provided to the State Department.

To help identify any potential non-"".gov"" correspondence that should be included, a search of first and last names of more than 100 State Department and other U.S. government officials was performed. This included all Deputy Secretaries, Under Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, Ambassadors-at-Large, Special Representatives and Envoys, members of the Secretary's Foreign Policy Advisory Board, and other senior officials to the Secretary, including close aides and staff.

Next, to account for non-obvious or non-recognizable email addresses or misspellings or other idiosyncrasies, the emails were sorted and reviewed both by sender and recipient.

Lastly, a number of terms were specifically searched for, including: ""Benghazi"" and ""Libya.""

These additional three steps yielded just over another 2,900 emails, including emails from former Administration officials and long-time friends that may not be deemed by the State Department to be federal records. And hundreds of these emails actually had already been forwarded onto the state.gov system and captured in real-time.

With respect to materials that the Select Committee has requested, the State Department has stated that just under 300 emails related to Libya were provided by the State Department to the Select Committee in response to a November 2014 letter, which contained a broader request for materials than prior requests from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

Given Clinton's practice of emailing State Department officials on their state.gov addresses, the State Department already had, and had already provided, the Select Committee with emails from Clinton in August 2014 – prior to requesting and receiving printed copies of her emails.

The review process described above confirmed Clinton's practice of emailing State Department officials on their .gov address, with the vast majority of the printed copies of work-related emails Clinton provided to the State Department simply duplicating what was already captured in the State Department's record-keeping system in real time.

Did Clinton use this account to communicate with foreign officials?

During her time at State, she communicated with foreign officials in person, through correspondence, and by telephone. The review of all of her emails revealed only one email with a foreign (UK) official.

Did she withhold any work emails? What about the 15 emails that Sid Blumenthal provided to the Select Committee that she did not provide to the State Department?

She provided the State Department with all work and potentially work-related emails that she had, including all of her correspondence with Sid Blumenthal. We understand that Mr. Blumenthal had some emails that Clinton did not have, and Clinton had some emails that Mr. Blumenthal did not have, but it is important to note that none of those emails provide any new insights on the attack on our facilities in Benghazi.

Do you think a third party should have been allowed to review what was turned over to the State Department, as well as the remainder that was not?

The Federal Records Act puts the obligation on the government official, not the agency or a third party, to determine what is and is not a federal record. The State Department Foreign Affairs Manual outlines guidance ""designed to help employees determine which of their e-mail messages must be preserved as federal records and which may be deleted without further authorization because they are not Federal record materials."" [5 FAM 443.1(c)].

Clinton responded to the State Department's request by providing approximately 55,000 pages of her work and potentially work-related emails. She has also taken the unprecedented step of asking that those emails be made public. In doing so, she has sought to support the State Department's efforts, fulfill her responsibility of record-keeping, and provide the chance for the public to assess the work she and officials at the State Department did during her tenure.

After her work-related emails were identified and preserved, Clinton chose not to keep her private, personal emails that were not federal records, including emails about her daughter's wedding plans, her mother's funeral service, family vacations, etc.

Government officials are granted the privacy of their personal, non-work related emails, including personal emails on .gov accounts. Clinton exercised her privilege to ensure the continued privacy of her personal, non-work related emails.

Can't she release the emails she provided to the State Department herself?

Because the printed copies of work-related emails she provided to the State Department include federal records of the Department, the Department needs to review these emails before they can be made public. She called for them to be made available as soon as possible, and is glad to see the Department has begun releasing them.

Some of the emails released show Clinton emailed aides at times on their personal, rather than .gov accounts. Was she trying to hide these communications?

As Clinton has said before, it was her practice to email U.S. government officials on their .gov accounts if it was work-related. This is evidenced in the emails released so far. In reviewing her emails in 2014, there was a fraction of emails with work-related information sent to U.S. government officials’ personal accounts, and those were provided to the State Department. The overwhelming majority of her work-related emails were to .gov accounts.

Where was the server for her email located?

The server for her email was physically located on her property, which is protected by U.S. Secret Service.

What level of encryption was employed? Who was the service provider?

The security and integrity of her family's electronic communications was taken seriously from the onset when it was first set up for President Clinton's team. While the curiosity about the specifics of this set up is understandable, given what people with ill intentions can do with such information in this day and age, there are concerns about broadcasting specific technical details about past and current practices. Suffice it to say, robust protections were put in place and additional upgrades and techniques employed over time as they became available, including consulting and employing third party experts.

Was the server ever hacked?

No, there is no evidence there was ever a breach.

Was there ever an unauthorized intrusion into her email or did anyone else have access to it?

No.

What was done after her email was exposed in February 2013 after the hacker known as ""Guccifer"" hacked Sid Blumenthal’s account?

While this was not a breach of Clinton's account, because her email address was exposed, steps were taken at that time to ensure the security and integrity of her electronic communications, including changing her email address.

Was the State Department able to respond to requests related to FOIA or Congressional requests before they received printed copies of her work-related emails?

Yes. As the Select Committee has said, the State Department provided the Committee with relevant emails it already had on the state.gov system before the State Department requested any printed copies from former Secretaries, and four months before the State Department received the printed copies.

For example, in the well-publicized hack of Sid Blumenthal's email account, a note he sent Clinton on September 12, 2012, was posted online. At first blush, one might not think this exchange would be captured on the state.gov system. But in fact, Clinton forwarded the email, that very same day, onto the state.gov system. And the email was produced by the State Department to the Select Committee, and acknowledged by the Select Committee, in August 2014.

This example illustrates: 1) when an email from a non-"".gov"" sender had some connection to work or might add to the understanding of State Department officials, it was Clinton’s practice to forward it to officials at their ""state.gov"" address; and 2) the State Department was able to search and produce Clinton’s emails when needed long before, and unrelated to, receiving the printed copies as they were already captured on state.gov accounts.",0
politifact13949,"Snopes Paid to Push ‘Propaganda’ by Facebook, Former Editor RevealsSnopes Paid to Push ‘Propaganda’ by Facebook, Former Editor Reveals

Claims 'fact-checkers' are paid to 'appear to prevent damage' while pushing an agenda

© press Former managing editor at Snopes Brooke Binkowski says the 'fact-checker' is pushing 'propaganda'

Snopes is paid by Facebook to push ""propaganda,"" according to the former managing editor of the ""fact-checker,"" who claims the social media giant ""doesn't care"" about facts and is using journalists to promote an agenda so it can ""pass the buck.""

According to a bombshell report by the Guardian, several current and former Facebook fact-checkers have stepped forward and spoken out to reveal their distrust in the social network and their fact-checking employers.

Facebook has fact-checking partnerships with Snopes, PolitiFact, Factcheck.org, the Weekly Standard, and Associated Press, and uses the information provided by these organizations to reduce the reach of posts that are ""debunked"" in their News Feed.

The partnering with these fact-checkers has come under heavy criticism, mainly due to the almost-monopolized influence news on Facebook has, which is then being filtered out by unregulated individuals who are often financially motivated and express political bias.

“They’ve essentially used us for crisis PR,” declared former Snopes managing editor Brooke Binkowski during an interview with the Guardian.

“They’re not taking anything seriously.

""They are more interested in making themselves look good and passing the buck…

""They clearly don’t care.”

“You’re not doing journalism anymore. You’re doing propaganda,” she continued, adding, “They threw us under the bus at every opportunity.”

Another former Snopes employee, Kim LaCapria, recently left the company over its partnership with Facebook, accusing it of focusing only on the “appearance of trying to prevent damage without actually doing anything,” and expressing distaste with the fact that Snopes was being paid by Facebook.

LaCapria said she was particularly upset to learn that Facebook was paying Snopes: “That felt really gross … Facebook has one mission and fact-checking websites should have a completely different mission.”

Aside from allegedly being paid by Facebook, Snopes also generates revenue by filling its website with advertisements from Google Adsense, asking for donations from readers via PayPal, and has an active GoFundMe campaign to ""Save Snopes"" which has so far generated over $850,000 of its $2 million goal.

Of course, it's understandable that a website has overheads that need to be covered, but when a company is primarily driven by profit, how can they be trusted to remain non-partisan?

According to a report by the Daily Mail, Snopes founder David Mikkelson was accused of embezzling thousands from the company.

Mikkelson's ex-wife Barbara, claimed in legal documents he embezzled $98,000 of company money and spent it on ""himself and prostitutes.""

During the lengthy and bitter legal dispute, CEO David Mikkelson also claimed to be underpaid and was demanding the ""industry standard"" or at least $360,000 a year.

Being motivated by ""facts"" is apparently very lucrative.

And in the case of Snopes, their business model is a simple, yet devastatingly effective one since they partnered with Facebook and Google: They debunk viral news, and posts.

Therefore, if a post goes viral on social media, and Snopes says that it's ""false,"" then it will be flagged as so and Facebook will place a link to the ""fact-check,"" thus driving more traffic and revenue to Snopes.

Due to this arrangement, it adds a clear incentive to mark a viral news story as false rather than confirming lesser-known facts as true.

© press Snopes founder David Mikkelson was accused on embezzling company money

Over recent months this push to flag big news stories as ""false,"" mainly from conservative websites, has become more apparent.

In November, Breitbart accused Snopes of attempting to ""wash away"" the story of armed members of the New Black Panther Party campaigning for the Democrat gubernatorial candidate in Georgia, Stacey Abrams.

According to Breitbart, the move was an ""openly partisan"" attempt to protect Abrams after the damaging story went viral.

Earlier this month, The Daily Caller also accused Snopes of left-bias after it ""botched"" its fact-check of a viral meme that was mocked within political circles for spreading false information.

Snopes said that the “general idea” of the meme was “correct,” yet, according to the TheDCNF, the fact-checker intentionally framed it that way as it portrayed President Trump in a negative light if the ""wildly misleading"" meme was true.

In Snopes ""transparency"" disclaimer, it states that it operates ""without any partisan considerations,"" saying:

""We don’t choose or exclude items for coverage based on whether they deal with Republican/Democratic, conservative/liberal, or religious/secular issues.""

Despite this statement, the left-leaning bias of their fact-checkers is clear.

Snopes' ""science dude"" Alex Kasprak makes no secret of his political bias, and one look at his Twitter account shows it is filled with anti-Trump rhetoric and retweets of Trump-bashing posts.

The only way to report on that ""totally clears the president"" tweet is to highlight it as an example of our president's abject delusion, not as a valid legal opinion or as ""breaking news"" — Alex H. Kasprak (@alexkasprak) December 8, 2018





Prior to joining Snopes, Kasprak wrote for left-wing news outlets Motherboard and BuzzFeed and is pegged as a ""science writer"" who mainly ""debunks"" science-related articles.

It comes as no surprise then that Kasprak mainly fact-checks conservative news sites, often using derogatory language when describing the outlets and their writers, using terms such as ""right-wing blog"" and ""junk news.""

Biting the hand that feeds

Snopes apparent bias has seen the company suffer considerably over recent months as it continues to abuse its influence over Facebook's News Feed to promote a political agenda.

Visits to snopes.com have plummeted by almost half over recent months as users are seemingly losing trust in the organization.

According to website data tool SimilarWeb, visits to Snopes dropped another 20 percent in November to 19.59 million for the month.

This number is a considerable drop from their July figure of 37.79 million, representing a staggering 48.16 percent drop in website traffic in just four months.

While it's unclear what has caused this drop, when you consider that being flagged as ""fake news"" on Facebook cuts reach to the websites being debunked, it's clear to see that attacking the sources of their viral ""fact-checks,"" is hardly sustainable if it destroys the sites that it continually attacks.

The appearance of trying to prevent damage

“Why should we trust Facebook when it’s pushing the same rumors that its own fact checkers are calling fake news?” an unnamed Facebook fact-checker told the Guardian.

“It’s worth asking how do they treat stories about George Soros on the platform knowing they specifically pay people to try to link political enemies to him?[…] Working with Facebook makes us look bad.”

According to Breitbart, one fact-checker who has reportedly “long worked” with Facebook even referred to the social network as a “terrible company,” declaring, “and, on a personal level, I don’t want to have anything to do with them,” while another fact-checker proclaimed, “Most of us feel it’s more trouble than it’s worth.”

Facebook started its fact-checking efforts following President Trump’s 2016 presidential election victory and is even expanding into fact-checking images and videos.

Left-wing biases have been found at nearly all Facebook fact-check partners in the United States, including Snopes, Politifact, and the Weekly Standard.

An investigation revealed that Snopes employs left-wing people almost exclusively, with some of its most prominent fact-checkers openly describing themselves as “progressive” and expressing anti-Trump sentiment.

A satirical article from popular satire website Babylon Bee about CNN using a washing machine to “spin the news,” was also nearly removed by Facebook after Snopes fact-checked it as false.

One of Facebook’s other top fact-checking partners, Politifact, is funded by a frequent Clinton Foundation donor, and gave preferential treatment to Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election — rating 51 percent of Clinton’s claims as true versus just over 15 percent for Trump.

Even a 2013 article from one of Facebook’s other fact-checking partners, the Weekly Standard, claimed Politifact “has it out for Republicans,” and the Weekly Standard itself has also pushed out misleading information during its partnership with Facebook.

UPDATE: Since this article was published, and subsequently went viral on social media, Snopes CEO David Mikkelson denied the information we presented in this article. Snopes didn't ""fact-check"" or ""debunk"" any of the information, nor did they present any evidence to refute the claims. Mikkelson, however, saw fit to abuse his position as Facebook approved ""fact-checker"" and flagged our story as a ""hoax"" with Facebook, pulling it from users' News Feed, immediately squashing the story as a result. Make of that what you will.",1

STATE OF THE UNION WITH CANDY CROWLEY

Interview with Mitch McConnell; Interview with Robert Gibbs

Aired July 8, 2012 - 09:00 ET

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.



CANDY CROWLEY, CNN ANCHOR: June disappoints with weak job numbers. Today, unemployment and the presidential race.



(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)



BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But it is still tough out there.



FORMER GOV. MITT ROMNEY, R-MASS., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This kick in the gut has got to end.



CROWLEY: Exclusive interviews with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Obama campaign senior adviser Robert Gibbs. Then the numbers and the politics of a sputtering economy with economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Mark Zandi, and CNN senior congressional correspondent, Dana Bash.



BILL BRADLEY, FORMER DEMOCRATIC SENATOR: If we are going to succeed, we have to face our problems squarely.



Former Democratic senator Bill Bradley on how to fix a broken Washington and what we can all do better. I'm Candy Crowley and this is STATE OF THE UNION.



(END VIDEOTAPE)



CROWLEY: Not the best of weeks for the Romney campaign. It was already under fire from friendly sources as not ready for prime time when a senior adviser said that ObamaCare is fine, for not buying insurance is not a penalty, not a tax. A big oops in political world because Republicans have used the Supreme Court decision to argue that ObamaCare is a tax hike on the middle class. Reset.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



ROMNEY: The Supreme Court has the final word, right? Is it the highest court in the land? They said it was a tax, didn't they?



UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So what do you --



ROMNEY: It's a tax. Of course, you --



CROWLEY: Too late for the conservative ""Wall Street Journal,"" which blistered the Romney campaign for looking confused and politically dumb. ""Mr. Romney,"" it read, ""promised Republicans he was the best man to make the case against President Obama, whom they desperately want to defeat. So far, Mr. Romney is letting them down.""



Joining me is Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. There are few people in Washington with a larger stake in seeing that Mitt Romney does well than you do, because you would like to go from minority leader in the Senate to majority. How do you think he has been doing? MCCONNELL: Well, the race is very, very close. I mean I think the best evidence of that is a Gallup tracking poll that has had it consistently very close. People are unhappy with the economy. They know that Mitt Romney is a job creator and I think he has got a great chance of being elected.



CROWLEY: But his campaign, as you know, has come under fire from Republicans, first as being not ready for prime time, as we said, that he needs a steady, sort of more national hand in this.



Do you have any complaints, first of all, about how they handled this whole Supreme Court tax issue, which is a major issue for you all?



MCCONNELL: Well, I think a better use of my time is to criticize the guys we are running against. I'm not here to critique the Romney campaign. I do think that we've got plenty to run against. The president has got a very, very poor record. That is why he does not want to talk about it.



I mean, take Friday's job figure, for example. You can go back two years ago and the job figure was better and the president said we are turning the -- we are turning it around. You know, clearly what they are doing is not working. And I think that is what this campaign needs to be about.



CROWLEY: And yet, we did look at the figures for this year, and you know that there were great advances in job creation in the first quarter. It's been minimal in the second quarter.



Nonetheless, still job creation. When you average out the first six months, it is something like 125,000-130,000 jobs have been created on average. That's not too bad considering where we came from, is it?



MCCONNELL: It is terrible. We have got 41 straight months now of unemployment above 8 percent, 41 straight months. Candy, this is the most tepid recovery -- if it is a recovery -- from a deep recession in American history.



The economy is just sputtering along and the reason for that, in my judgment, is because of what the administration chose to do: spend, borrow, pass this new ObamaCare law with its penalty tax in it, its mandate tax. All of this is slowing the economy down.



CROWLEY: Let me ask you about the president's jobs plan that was introduced last September, I think. And something -- this is what he is saying on the campaign trail. This was in Columbus, Ohio, in an interview with WBNS.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



OBAMA: -- making sure that we're rebuilding the infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our runways, all those things that could put construction workers back to work right now and would lift the entire economy and then, as I said, refocusing on manufacturing. That's the recipe for growth over the long term.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CROWLEY: So what's wrong with any of that? Shouldn't Congress, at this point, be saying the American people want this economy to be better? Isn't it incumbent on you all to find something you can agree on in the long list of things the president put in that jobs package and move it forward?



MCCONNELL: Well, we just passed a transportation bill, so we were addressing an issue that we had broad agreement on, that transportation is important to our economy.



But look, the way we're going to get the private sector going again is to change the way the government is treating the private sector. Things like ObamaCare, things like overregulation are causing companies not to hire. And we have got the fiscal cliff coming at the end of the year.



You know, what we ought to be doing is extend the current tax rates for another year with a hard requirement to get through comprehensive tax reform one more time. I negotiated with Vice President Biden the two-year extension of the current tax rates that we're in right now.



The president signed it because he argued that to let taxes going up would make the economy worse. We have a slower growth rate today than we had then. That would settle at least part of the problem.



CROWLEY: Let me ask you though, because they are doing nothing because you all are at odds over what you should do, is in fact, a lot of people argue, slowing the growth of the economy here in the U.S. and adding to the jobless rate, which is pretty tepid.



I want to play you something from the managing director of the IMF.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



CHRISTINE LAGARDE, MANAGING DIRECTOR, IMF: The threat, only the threat of the delay in raising the debt ceiling and of the fiscal cliff could weaken growth already later this year, and should they materialize because no agreement can be reached, the domestic effects would be severe with negative spillovers to the rest of the world.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CROWLEY: So basically IMF is saying if you don't come off this fiscal cliff -- and by you, I mean Congress -- it is going to add to the uncertainty. There are certain things -- ObamaCare, you've mentioned it; regulations, that's fine.



You're not going to the Democrats to agree on it, but something that Congress could do is something about this oncoming train, which everyone sees coming, and yet there's no action. MCCONNELL: Well, what we could do and is what the House is going to do this week, I believe, is go ahead and extend the current tax rates for another year. That deals with part of the fiscal cliff.



(CROSSTALK)



CROWLEY: The president said he would veto that, so --



MCCONNELL: The president shouldn't veto that. This is the same president who signed the very same thing two years ago with the argument --



CROWLEY: I understand.



MCCONNELL: -- to do otherwise would make the economy worse.



CROWLEY: Yes.



MCCONNELL: I mean, look, the principal reason that we're having this economic trough is what the government is doing to the private sector. Now the president keeps talking about public sector employees.



Unemployment in the public sector is 4.2 percent. We've got to get the private sector going. That is only the way you have job growth, which creates revenue for the government. Everything this administration has done, Candy, has taken us in the wrong direction.



CROWLEY: But they would argue that the stimulus plan and other things they've done since and investing in infrastructure, getting construction jobs going, hiring the teachers, policemen, that that has kept this economy from being even worse over a longer period of time.



And I think, you know, again, we are seeing the same arguments we have seen now --



MCCONNELL: Yes, I know.



CROWLEY: -- for a year and a half. And I sense out there in the country -- and now we're seeing from the IMF -- that what is really worrying people is that you do nothing. It is almost not the something that you do, it is that you look up to Capitol Hill for some sort of guidance. When was the last time that you sat down with the Senate majority leader and said. how can we do this?



MCCONNELL: We have passed 11 different things the president has asked us to pass in the last six months. That is not the point.



The point is this: for two years the administration was able to do everything they wanted to. They borrowed. They spent. They had the government take over American health care. That's all in place, and the question the American people should be asking is how is that working?



Now the president would like to do more of the same. We don't think that makes sense. Why don't we try doing things that get the private sector -- which is the only way we're going to ever (inaudible) going again.



CROWLEY: We don't try, because you are in the minority and not a majority in the Senate, and yet the minority in the Senate can stop things, so, you know, the fact of the matter is don't you and Senator Reid need to sit down and say, here is how we can help the economy? Here's what we can agree on? Have you all done that?



MCCONNELL: We have, as I just indicated, passed a number of things the president's asked for.



CROWLEY: Have you sat down with senator Reid looking forward?



(CROSSTALK)



MCCONNELL: Sure. We -- every day we talk about the way forward and we have passed a number of pieces of legislation that are important and are helpful. But the primary problem is the president would like for us to keep doing more of what he was able to do the first two years when he had total control of Congress.



The American people have looked at the results of that. It clearly has not worked.



CROWLEY: Let me turn you to the Senate race races that are out there. Sitting here today and looking at the landscape, do you believe you will be the majority leader next year?



MCCONNELL: 50-50. I think it is going to be a very close, competitive election. There are a number of places where we have opportunities for pickups, not many places where we have much chance of losing a seat. I think at the end of the day, we will have a very narrow Senate one way or the other.



CROWLEY: And looking at the Virginia race and the Massachusetts race?



MCCONNELL: Two close races. Good candidates --



(CROSSTALK)



CROWLEY: You could lose as easily as you could win?



MCCONNELL: I'm sorry?



CROWLEY: You could lose as easily as you could win?



MCCONNELL: Well, they are close races. We expect to win them both, but they are close races. CROWLEY: And as you look at the Supreme Court decision over the past week and the reaction to it, and you read, I'm assuming Justice Roberts', Chief Justice Roberts' opinion on that -- are you sorry you voted for him?



MCCONNELL: No, I'm not, but I was extremely disappointed. The chief justice, however, did make it clear that the mandate is a tax, and if I may make an observation about that, Candy, you know, the mandate tax, 77 percent of it will be levied on people making $120,000 and less. And interestingly enough, that produces more tax revenue for the government than the so-called Buffett tax which the president tried to get us to pass to raise taxes on high income people.



CROWLEY: And yet there is 330 million-plus population in the U.S. or around in there, we are talking about maybe about 3 million people, at least according to the CBO, how this would -- I mean the congressional folks, according to them, this would affect maybe 3 million people. That is not that much to get 30 million people covered, is it?



MCCONNELL: Well, look, the question is the law in its entirety. The president said it would not raise taxes. It is raising taxes.



CROWLEY: On very few people, though, you would concede that.



MCCONNELL: Well, it is important to those people, and they are middle-income people. More tax revenue raised from middle-income people than the Buffett tax would raise from high-income people from a president who promised not to raise taxes on anyone. It is also driving premiums up. The cost of health care is going up. It cut Medicare by half a trillion dollars over the next ten years. Nothing that was said in connection with passing this health care bill is working out.



CROWLEY: Senator, I want you thank you for joining us this morning. I hope you will come back.



MCCONNELL: I will.



CROWLEY: Jobs and the president's plan for winning the battleground states with Obama campaign senior adviser Robert Gibbs when we come back.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CROWLEY: I'm joined by Obama campaign senior adviser Robert Gibbs. Good to see you, Robert.



I want to run you through a series of economic figures and polls, and then get your comment at the end. First of all, when you ask folks what are economic conditions like today -- good, 27 percent. Poor, 73 percent. When you say, how important is the economy to your vote? 92 percent say it is either very or extremely important to their vote.



GIBBS: Who are the other 8 percent? CROWLEY: Exactly. To their vote. And then finally, who would better handle the economy. Romney 48 percent, Obama 47 percent. If the economy is doing better, as the president argues, not as good as you want but better, why are those numbers like that?



GIBBS: Well, look, I think we are coming out of the hardest economic time in our country's history. CROWLEY: Which we have been doing for four years.



GIBBS: We have been, and typically when you come out of the recession, the depths that we were in, that's caused by a financial crisis, which is what happened, it takes a while to dig out of that hole. We saw on Friday that our economy is growing and we are adding jobs. The president believes that --



CROWLEY: Not enough jobs.



GIBBS: We are not growing fast enough and we're not adding enough jobs.



CROWLEY: So what is the argument to, like, after four years, what is then the argument that re-elect me?



GIBBS: Well, Candy, we have made progress, but we have got a long way to go, and this is going to be an election about two different visions. You heard part of it here just a minute ago with Senator McConnell and you hear it with Mitt Romney every day. The best way to create jobs is to provide millionaires and billionaires with greater tax cuts, take financial regulations off of things like banks and Wall Street, and somehow we will see jobs flourish for years and years to come. The problem with that is that it is not a theory. We tried it for eight years, and it ended in this huge economic calamity and this financial mess.



CROWLEY: But the jobs are not flourishing now, and folks don't actually seem to think that the president would handle it better than Mitt Romney, so I'm just trying to figure out what the sales pitch is here.



GIBBS: Well, the other vision is that we have to grow this economy like we did for years and years and decades from the middle- class out. Let's continue to add opportunity, let's bring this American dream back, let's guarantee that if you work hard and play by the rules, you will have a chance to get ahead, that your children will have a chance to get ahead. And again, we have tried these different philosophies before. We know what tax breaks and tax cuts for the wealthy and financial regulations off of Wall Street mean. They mean economic calamity, they mean what we are dealing with now, versus a vision where we add jobs and build out of the middle-class. People take responsibility, they work hard, but they get ahead. And that is what we need to do.



CROWLEY: I think, you know, even the Republicans would, you know, that you think have this different version, would say, we want to grow the middle-class, that is where our aim is.



GIBBS: That is not their primary aim. Their primary aim is to give tax breaks to the very wealthy.



CROWLEY: That is what you think their primary aim is, but --



GIBBS: Let's look at the central plank in Mitt Romney's so- called economic plan. And granted, this is -- most of his economic plans and most of his plans are secret, but the one thing that he has fleshed out is to take the Bush tax cuts, which disproportionately impact millionaires and billionaires, and add to them. Candy, do you think we are a Bush tax away for a millionaire away from a flourishing economy? Or should we protect and keep taxes low for middle-class families and give them a chance?



CROWLEY: Do you think the president will do anything other than veto a bill that would keep those Bush tax cuts for everyone intact?



GIBBS: We should protect the tax cuts for the middle-class, and we should let tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires expire.



CROWLEY: Even though recovery is not that great, and people say don't take money out of this economy, it is not the time for a tax hike, you would go ahead and do it for those making $250,000 and above.



GIBBS: We ought to do something about this deficit, and we ought to protect middle class tax cuts, and the best way to do that is to let the upper-end tax cuts expire, let the wealthy in this country that had been doing fine for years and years and years begin to pay their fair share, and make sure that we protect the tax rate that middle-class families have had for the past many years.



CROWLEY: So the president is totally committed to getting rid of the tax cut for those making $250,000 and above.



GIBBS: Let's make some progress on our spending by doing away with tax cuts for people who quite frankly don't need them, tax cuts that have not worked, and have them pay their fair share.



CROWLEY: So is that a yes or a no? The president is completely committed to this, he won't allow it to happen?



GIBBS: He is 100 percent committed to it.



CROWLEY: OK. I want to play an ad that you all have been running, and then ask you about it.



Or not.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mitt Romney campaigned as a job creator.



ROMNEY: I know how jobs are created.



UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But as a corporate raider, he shipped jobs to China and Mexico. As a governor, he did the same thing, outsourcing state jobs to India. Now he is making the exact same pitch. ROMNEY: I know why the jobs come and why they go.



UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Outsourcing jobs, Romney economics, it didn't work then and it won't work now.



(END VIDEOTAPE)



CROWLEY: You all have invested very heavily in the Bain Capital element of trying to convince people of what Mitt Romney is about. And yet, this particular ad got four pinocchios from the Washington Post, which is not true. And this is what Factcheck.org had to say. ""We found no evidence to support the claim that Romney, while he was still running Bain Capital, shipped American jobs overseas."" You now have a similar ad out. Why do you keep with that?



GIBBS: Well, I've got to say factcheck.org ought to read the Washington Post, which is the one that came up with a report that said looking at SEC filings that Mitt Romney and Bain Capital were pioneers in outsourcing. They shipped jobs all over the world that could and should have been--



CROWLEY: You say that Romney was, but the point, their point is that in fact, Mitt Romney was not running Bain. He had cut ties and gone off.



GIBBS: That also is not true, because Mitt Romney was the head and sole owner of Bain longer than Mitt Romney has admitted to being the sole owner of Bain.



But let's understand this, because we saw this a little bit again this week. We have got a guy who believes and has been a pioneer in outsourcing jobs, and quite frankly, he offshores most of his own personal investments, presumably to shield them from taxes.



Candy, I don't know about you, I pick a bank because there is an ATM near my home, right? Mitt Romney has a bank account in Switzerland. He's got a shell company--



CROWLEY: Nothing illegal, right? You are not charging that he has done anything illegal with any of this? GIBBS: Candy, nobody knows why he has a corporation in Bermuda, why he failed to disclose that on seven different financial disclosures, why he transferred it to somebody else's purview the day before he became governor of Massachusetts. The one thing he can do, Candy, to clear up whether or not he's done anything illegal, whether he's shielding his income from taxes in Bermuda or Switzerland, is to do what every other presidential candidate has done, and that is release a series of years of their own tax returns. Mitt Romney's father was the pioneer for releasing a series of tax returns. The best way to figure out if Mitt Romney is complying with American tax law is to have him release more of his tax returns.



This is a guy whose slogan is believe in America, and it should be business in Bermuda, that is what Mitt Romney is all about.



CROWLEY: Which is a great line, but again, there is no evidence here that any of the fact check organizations have found that A, he outsourced jobs, or was president of Bain when it happened, and B, that he has done anything illegal. You have had a lot of advice from folks, Democrats saying get off of this particular Bain thing. There is obviously some polling that shows in fact it's having some effect in some of the battleground states, but why--



GIBBS: Again, this is an ad that's based on a report that the Washington Post did. OK? So I would encourage everyone go to Washingtonpost.com and read that report. The reason that we'll keep talking about this is, this is important. Are we going to create jobs here in America, we're going to bring them back from overseas, we're going to do away with tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas, or are we going to invest in manufacturing here in this country? You know, we have created half a million manufacturing jobs. More manufacturing jobs have been created in the last few years than since the mid-90s. Mitt Romney famously said we ought to let Detroit and the auto industry go bankrupt. Again, I go back to two very different visions about this economy.



CROWLEY: Right. I have to end it there, I'm sorry, I hope you come back. Robert Gibbs, senior adviser to the Obama campaign. Thanks.



GIBBS: Thank you.



CROWLEY: Four more jobs reports before the election, the problems and the solutions when we come back.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



ROMNEY: The president's policies have not gotten America working again.



OBAMA: Businesses have created 4.4 million new jobs over the past 28 months.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



(COMMERCIAL BREAK) CROWLEY: With me now, Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, former Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Holtz- Eakin, and CNN senior congressional correspondent Dana Bash. So let's just straighten out this economy thing. And have you all tell me, A, what was the most worrisome thing in the economic report we got, the jobless report, and what makes you think, OK, we can still survive this. Let's start with you.



ZANDI: Well, 80,000 jobs is pretty disappointing. If we stick at 80,000, if that is the reality of what is going on, then unemployment is going to rise, and we have an 8.2 percent unemployment rate, and that is a problem. So that is the most worrisome aspect of the report.



But there were some positives -- hours worked increased. That's a good leading indicator. Businesses will ask workers to work longer hours before they hire. And we did see--



CROWLEY: So that is a precursor to new jobs.



ZANDI: It is.



CROWLEY: Sometimes.



ZANDI: Generally is. And hours worked were actually at a pretty high level, so any pickup of activity will probably translate into more jobs, and we got a big increase in wages, which was encouraging. I had been nervous that wage growth had been slowing, but that does not appear to be the case. It is pretty solid.



CROWLEY: Douglas, what do you think?



HOLTZ-EAKIN: Well, those points are right. One of the real disappointing characteristics of this recovery has been not just the jobs, but the lack of income growth, and that has hurt the ability of households to spend, and to see some strength in wages was a very important part of this report.



I think the really troubling issue is that this report came on the heels of some other reports that showed manufacturing slowing, the service sector slowing, and to the extent that employment is a lagging sort of indicator, that we could have further trouble down the road. And I'm worried about the outlook for that reason.



CROWLEY: I tried to get Robert Gibbs to tell us how the president plays this at this point, because I think people look and think, we just thought we'd be so much further along. How do the Romney folks play this, and is there any sign that it is working, and what can the president do?



BASH: Well, the Romney folks, what they think their message is going to be going forward isn't so much the Reagan, are you better off now than you were four years ago? It's what we all witnessed four years ago, the high expectations, the soaring rhetoric, the -- you know, as Sarah Palin would say, the ""hopey-changey"" thing. Do you feel that? Or do you feel like -- ?



CROWLEY: Consumer confidence?



BASH: What happened? What happened?



CROWLEY: Yes.



BASH: So it's not -- it's that the expectations were set so high, and that is what the Romney campaign wants to hit big time going forward.



Having said that, there was some criticism, sort of friendly fire, from Republican editorial boards -- you showed some of the quotes to Mitch McConnell. That's a concern because Mitt Romney should be doing very well against somebody with 8.2 percent unemployment. And the concern is, especially given the fact that his calling card is business acumen, why isn't he doing better?



CROWLEY: Let me read you something from Brian Cropp (ph) -- I don't know if either one of you know him -- he is on the corporate executive board, a managing director here, and here is what he had to say about a two-tiered job market.



""We continue to hear from companies that it's a two-tiered labor market. For people who have been employed with professional and technical skills, it's a decent job market. But for the rest of the workforce, it's still very difficult.""



Is that accurate that we're getting a sort of a two Americas when you look at the jobless rate?



HOLTZ-EAKIN: I think there's an element or two to it. But to say that there is two Americas is too strong. I mean, it is always the case that during expansions, some skills and some sectors do better than others, and we are seeing that right now. There's no question. High school people have done better, and that is not unusual, especially in tough economic times.



So the challenge is to have enough economic growth that the people who have -- at the moment have sort of a relatively low-skilled job can get in, get the kind of experience that allows them to turn into the other part of America, and we're just not seeing that right now.



ZANDI: I am sympathetic to that description. I mean, I think if you have education, if you've gone to college, if you have the skills, you are doing OK. You're doing pretty well. If you look at the unemployment rates for people with college degrees and lots of skills, very -- it is really quite low.



CROWLEY: (Inaudible).



ZANDI: (Inaudible). And those folks that don't have skills and education, they are getting creamed in this economy.



CROWLEY: And that --



HOLTZ-EAKIN: I think the key here is the income. I think -- they might have jobs, but they're not getting college and skilled level incomes out of this recovery, and the other guys are getting creamed.



BASH: And that does feed into the political divide of the two Americas, Candy, no question, that President Obama historically has struggled with the sort of uneducated voter or the voter who doesn't have the high education, and he struggles with the lunch bucket voter, and this feeds right into that.



ZANDI: I want to push back on your point about people expecting this to be better than it is. The reality is that, after financial crises, like the one we went through -- and it was a devastating crisis -- you just look at the string of financial institutions that just are no longer with us, you always have very weak economic recovery. This is the history of economics, all the way back to the 1400s.



So it's not atypical that an economy would struggle like it is, and we have made improvements. I mean --



(CROSSTALK)



CROWLEY: You would know that because you know stuff like that, but --



HOLTZ-EAKIN: And the president and his advisers pooh-poohed that research early on, said no, no, no, that's not true. We can do this and get out quicker and they sold it politically that they would get out quicker, and they were probably wrong.



ZANDI: And, Doug, I think we are going to get out quicker than what has happened typically in history, but in history, it has been a decade before economies get out. And we're going to get out a lot faster than that, but, you know, we're only three years, four years after the nadir of all of this.



And to say we have created 4 million jobs in the last couple of years, I think that's actually quite an improvement.



But you are right, Candy, I'm talking as an economist. I'm not talking as a person on the street who has been nailed by this.



BASH: And we are in a fast food nation right now. We're in the Twitter nation, where three years is six lifetimes, where everything happens very, very fast. And that's the problem (inaudible).



CROWLEY: I want you all to stick with me. We've talked about the problems. After the break, we want to talk about some solutions.



And later, solving Washington's problems may be easier than you might think.



BILL BRADLEY, FORMER DEMOCRATIC SENATOR: It is not a quick fix, but it begins essentially by people telling you the truth.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CROWLEY: With me now, Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody Analytics, former Congressional Budget Office director Douglas Holtz- Eakin, and CNN senior congressional correspondent Dana Bash.



I have talked to folks, like you all, that have said, you know, the truth is, there is not a whole lot the president or even the Fed can do to make a major change in the state of the economy, that we are now looking at a kind of a new normal with above 6 percent unemployment for the out years, as they say, maybe a decade or so to come. Do you go with that?



ZANDI: Not me. No, I disagree totally with that. I think our economy is on the precipice of very strong economic growth. I think that American companies have restructured, they've gotten their cost structures down, they've reduced debt, they have lots of cash. It's a matter of confidence. It's not a matter of ability to go out and expand. And I think they will. And I think there's a lot that the Federal Reserve and the administration and Congress can do, most importantly -- you were talking about this with senator McConnell -- is we have got to nail down this fiscal cliff because this is making business people nervous and it's the reason why they are not taking that step to hire more workers.



So I don't think we're in a new normal.



CROWLEY: Are you bullish about the future?



HOLTZ-EAKIN: We get to dictate the normal. In the '60s and '70s, we took a series of policy steps that left us with chronic high inflation, chronic high unemployment. And then we changed course in the '80s and '90s, and we got a much better performance.



So I'm with Mark. We can do much better than we're doing now. I don't think that if you round up the usual cast of characters -- this is a lot like ""Casablanca"" -- that you look at the Fed, I actually don't think there's much th",0

FOUNTAIN | Times] Mike Hughes of Largo, Pam Wilson of Indian Rocks Beach and Nora Harvey of Dunedin sit outside the Renaissance Vinoy Resort in St. Petersburg protesting Sen. John McCain’s fundraiser there Wednesday. About 50 people, including Democrats and union members, came out against the presumptive Republican nominee for president, whom they called “McSame” as President Bush. Wilson made signs for the protest. Jack Ganzell of Dunedin, far right, says he came out because he wanted to see what was going on. Related Links Audio: Excerpts of McCain's interview with the Times' Adam Smith ST. PETERSBURG — Charlie Crist may not yet have a full gubernatorial term under his belt, but Sen. John McCain said Wednesday Crist has enough experience to be vice president. ""Oh, I am sure that in many respects Charlie Crist is qualified. He's had other offices. As we know, he was attorney general as well. This is a big and diverse state,"" McCain said in an interview Wednesday evening before a $1,000-per-person private fundraising reception. ""But we haven't moved anywhere on the process that he would be under,"" the presumptive Republican presidential nominee stressed. ""We have a large number of people that we are considering, but I just don't mention anybody's name because then it starts a process that could end up in an invasion of their privacy."" In a taped interview to air Sunday on Political Connections on Bay News 9, McCain said he will reach out to supporters of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton and noted his independence from President Bush on such issues as government spending and climate control. ""I promise them that I'll be the president of all the people, not just Republicans or anybody else, but all the people,"" McCain said. ""I realize that I have to get independents and Democrats if I'm going to win this election."" He also decried the giant Confederate flag that's been proposed to fly near the intersection of Interstates 4 and 75 in Hills­borough County. McCain has faced this issue before, and has voiced profound regret for not taking a stand against a rebel flag atop the South Carolina statehouse during the 2000 GOP primary. ""It's a free country,"" McCain said of the flag in Hillsborough, but he said the Civil War memorial group behind the flag plans ""should consider the feelings and sensitivities on this issue at a time like this in America where we want to move forward."" Now that the Democratic nominee has been chosen, McCain knows he faces an opponent in Sen. Barack Obama who is more inspiring and energetic on the stump. McCain isn't worried. ""I think people are very interested in substance, as well as style,"" he said. McCain also struck on a theme of his campaign, suggesting Obama lacks the experience and knowledge to be president. But polls show a strong majority of American voters think invading Iraq was a mistake, which is what Obama said all along. When asked if Obama showed better judgment in opposing the invasion, McCain defended the war as the right call because ""every intelligence agency in the world believed that (Saddam Hussein) had weapons of mass destruction."" What about Florida's Bob Graham, the former Senate Intelligence Committee chairman who argued at the time that invading Iraq would divert attention and resources from more urgent threats, particularly al-Qaida? ""I respect Sen. Graham enormously, but I don't think there's any doubt that Saddam Hussein, who had acquired and used weapons of mass destruction before, had invaded a neighbor, Kuwait, where we had to fight one war with him, that his intent was … to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction,"" McCain replied. The private fundraising reception at the Renaissance Vinoy Resort in St. Petersburg kicked off a three-day Florida swing, which includes a speech to newspaper editors in Orlando today and an event touting his environmental credentials in the Everglades on Friday. Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton dismissed McCain's efforts to cast himself as anything but a continuation of President Bush's agenda. ""While John McCain has a record of occasional independence from his party in the past, last year he chose to embrace 95 percent of George Bush's agenda, including his failed economic policies and his failed policy in Iraq,"" Burton said referring to McCain's voting record. ""No matter how hard he tries to spin it otherwise, that kind of record is simply not the change the American people are looking for or deserve."" McCain said he supports the antigay marriage ballot initiatives in Florida and California, even though the Republican governors of both states have little interest in those efforts. While he voted against a federal marriage amendment proposal, McCain noted that he supported a similar initiative in his home state of Arizona, where voters rejected the idea. ""I think it's important to preserve the unique status of a marriage between men and women,"" McCain said. ""I respect the views of others who don't hold that view, but I also think that we have a process in our states to amend our constitutions to reflect the will of the majority of the people."" Adam C.

He's checked out on state, just as soon as he won. He's spent valuable time kissing McCain's tush while he could've been solving real problems here. I bet Jim Davis is peeved by Steve Jun 5, 2008 3:18 PM I'm surprised (not really) at how anti-gay McCain is (courting the homophobe vote). He is for an anti-gay state ammendment in a state he doesn't live in governed by a possible running mate who is against the ammendment. I know who I'll vote for now. by jim Jun 5, 2008 3:13 PM maybe charlie can get his friend pearlman to run a drive for McCain by Rich Jun 5, 2008 3:00 PM Senile John and empty Charlie..after clueless George.

I am torn between 2 worthless candidates. It could be an old fashioned coin toss. by john Jun 5, 2008 11:52 AM Well I know who I'm not voting for if he does chose Charlie. You know every King needs a court jester. by fj Jun 5, 2008 11:52 AM If Bush can be a president ...when he can't even read ....why cant Crist be a Vice President! Lets face it our standards have been lower'd by Bush! Apparently a trained monkey can be President! by C. Jun 5, 2008 11:52 AM So fairly-new Gov. Crist has experience to be one step away from the presidency, but Sen. Obama doesn't have the experience to be president, though he's more experienced than Crist? McCain, how will you explain yourself out of this one? by Kim Jun 5, 2008 11:52 AM I said I could never vote for Obama, but if McCain pick Crist, I will have not choice, I will have to throw McCain under the bus.... by Pete Jun 5, 2008 11:52 AM Good. Maybe we can get him out of the governor's seat then. He's been dangerous to Floridians in that role since day 1. by billy Jun 5, 2008 11:52 AM ""at least bush had ideas..."" bush had terrible ideas, and look at the results of his ideas and his gut reactions. i am not a republican, but i must say that crist is far more intelligent and acceptable than bush. by kitty Jun 5, 2008 10:52 AM Another reason to NOT vote for ya! Thanks for the warning johnny boy! by Zander Jun 5, 2008 10:52 AM ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? Charlie Crist seems like a nice guy but he is no more qualified to be VP than Obama is qualified to be President. by JH Jun 5, 2008 10:52 AM Graham said we should be focusing on Iran not Iraq and that's why he voted against going to Iraq. Al qaeda's zawahiri stated that Iraq was the central front in the war against the west. It's time the far left admitted defeat. We are winning in Iraq. by Ted Jun 5, 2008 10:51 AM After watching both McCain’s and Obama’s speeches on TV Tuesday night, McCain no less than NEEDS to run Alaska Gov Sarah Palin as his VP mate. by Marie Jun 5, 2008 10:51 AM God help us. RINOs by Clifford Jun 5, 2008 10:51 AM Charlie doesn't pass the White Picket fence test - he isn't married, has no children, and doesn't own property. Unless you consider the child that the mother says is Charlie's but CC won't submit to a DNA test. Charlie is also dating a married woman! by Cindi Jun 5, 2008 10:51 AM If McCain picks Charlie Crist for VP this demonstrates an incredible lack of knowledge. Crist does nothing unless he knows that it will not decrease his popularity.What has he done as Gov? Nothing! I have never voted for him and won't in November. by Bill Jun 5, 2008 10:51 AM Please take empty chair Charlie with you. He's done NOTHING to help with any of the real Florida issues. At least Bush had ideas........Crist has none. by peggy Jun 5, 2008 10:51 AM MCCain was promoted by Crist's tactic to endorse him. Crist did this knowing personally from Guiliani that Guilliani was throwing all his eggs into Florida primary fight.For Crist's short list pick, he destroyed the younger more vibrant candidate. by Joshu Jones Jun 5, 2008 10:50 AM ""Saddam Hussein who had acquired and used weapons of mass destruction before, .... that his intent was … to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction."" So the US just doesn't supply him with any more. Problem Solved! by Debbie Jun 5, 2008 10:50 AM And there you have it folks. Signs of dementia already. Crist is no more qualified to be vice president than Obama is to be president. What poor choices we have all because the process is tainted by money... by Holly Jun 5, 2008 10:50 AM As we all know, there are two sides to every polician!

politifact13260,"PolitiFact’s annotated transcript of the second presidential debateBy PolitiFact staff

PolitiFact is annotating the second presidential debate at Washington University. We will be posting the transcript and our annotations through the night. Follow us on Medium and check back regularly to see our commentary.

RADDATZ: Ladies and gentlemen the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.

COOPER: Thank you very much for being here. We’re going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall. Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question. Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you’ll go first. Our first question comes from Patrice Brock. Patrice?

QUESTION: Thank you, and good evening. The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines. Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students’ homework, do you feel you’re modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today’s youth?

CLINTON: Well, thank you. Are you a teacher? Yes, I think that that’s a very good question, because I’ve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.

And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we’re good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them into working on behalf of our country.

I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. That’s why the slogan of my campaign is “Stronger Together,” because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals — and I’ve set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.

If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there’s nothing in my opinion that America can’t do. So that’s why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, I’m hoping to earn your vote, I’m hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.

I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion. I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that’s, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.

TRUMP: Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. I’ve gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I’ve been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe I’m saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.

TRUMP: And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what’s happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it’s a one-sided transaction where we’re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we’ve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.

When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it’s in business and trade, where we’re doing so badly. Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. It’s hard to believe. Inconceivable.

You say who’s making these deals? We’re going the make great deals. We’re going to have a strong border. We’re going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen was shot, two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice.

But I want to do things that haven’t been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it. It’s called make America great again.

COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today’s youth? We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine. You called what you said locker room banter. You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?

TRUMP: No, I didn’t say that at all. I don’t think you understood what was — this was locker room talk. I’m not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly I’m not proud of it. But this is locker room talk.

You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have — and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. We haven’t seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.

And they look and they see. Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see what’s going on.

Yes, I’m very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But it’s locker room talk, and it’s one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. We’re going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.

COOPER: So, Mr. Trump…

TRUMP: And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.

COOPER: Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?

TRUMP: I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.

COOPER: So, for the record, you’re saying you never did that?

TRUMP: I’ve said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said. And I was embarrassed by it. But I have tremendous respect for women.

COOPER: Have you ever done those things?

TRUMP: And women have respect for me. And I will tell you: No, I have not. And I will tell you that I’m going to make our country safe. We’re going to have borders in our country, which we don’t have now. People are pouring into our country, and they’re coming in from the Middle East and other places.

We’re going to make America safe again. We’re going to make America great again, but we’re going to make America safe again. And we’re going to make America wealthy again, because if you don’t do that, it just — it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.

COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.

TRUMP: Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they’re taking our wealth.

COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.

TRUMP: And that’s what I want to talk about.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?

CLINTON: Well, like everyone else, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw. You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.

Donald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesn’t represent who he is.

But I think it’s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. Because we’ve seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. We’ve seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. We’ve seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.

So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is. But it’s not only women, and it’s not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.

So this is who Donald Trump is. And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are. That’s why — to go back to your question — I want to send a message — we all should — to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.

CLINTON: These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love. And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I’m so fortunate enough to become your president.

RADDATZ: And we want to get to some questions from online…

TRUMP: Am I allowed to respond to that? I assume I am.

RADDATZ: Yes, you can respond to that.

TRUMP: It’s just words, folks. It’s just words. Those words, I’ve been hearing them for many years. I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.

I’ve heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible. I’m going to help the African-Americans. I’m going to help the Latinos, Hispanics. I am going to help the inner cities.

She’s done a terrible job for the African-Americans. She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later. We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator. She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign…

RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump — I want to get to audience questions and online questions.

TRUMP: So, she’s allowed to do that, but I’m not allowed to respond?

RADDATZ: You’re going to have — you’re going to get to respond right now.

TRUMP: Sounds fair.

RADDATZ: This tape is generating intense interest. In just 48 hours, it’s become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network. As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic. Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, “Trump says the campaign has changed him. When did that happen?” So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that. When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently? And you have two minutes for this.

TRUMP: It was locker room talk, as I told you. That was locker room talk. I’m not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, I’m not proud of it. But that was something that happened.

If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he’s done to women. There’s never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that’s been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.

Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and she’s seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.

So don’t tell me about words. I am absolutely — I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, who’s also here tonight.

And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it’s disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.

(APPLAUSE)

RADDATZ: Can we please hold the applause? Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.

CLINTON: Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he’s just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses. He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. Instead of answering people’s questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that’s his choice.

When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.

(APPLAUSE) And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he’s saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.

CLINTON: He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq. And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.

He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn’t be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, “Mexican.”

He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching. And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America. He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.

TRUMP: Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal — he’s another real winner that you have — and he’s the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology. You’re the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.

Number two, Michelle Obama. I’ve gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I’ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I’ve ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.

So, you talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance. And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.

But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.

And I’ll tell you what. I didn’t think I’d say this, but I’m going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we’re going to have a special prosecutor.

When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where e-mails — and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.

So we’re going to get a special prosecutor, and we’re going to look into it, because you know what? People have been — their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you’ve done. And it’s a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.

(CROSSTALK)

RADDATZ: I’m going to let you talk about e-mails.

CLINTON: … because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I’m not surprised.

TRUMP: Oh, really?

CLINTON: In the first debate…

(LAUGHTER)

RADDATZ: And really, the audience needs to calm down here.

CLINTON: … I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time. I’d never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we’re going to really make lives better for people.

So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com. We have literally Trump — you can fact check him in real time. Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we’ll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is — it’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.

TRUMP: Because you’d be in jail.

(APPLAUSE)

RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton…

COOPER: We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud. Please do not applaud. You’re just wasting time.

RADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails. You’ve said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake. You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, “extremely careless.” The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails. You don’t call that extremely careless? CLINTON: Well, Martha, first, let me say — and I’ve said before, but I’ll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it — that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account. Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not. I’m not making any excuses. It was a mistake. And I am very sorry about that.

But I think it’s also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others. After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all — anyone who says otherwise has no basis — that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.

I take classified materials very seriously and always have. When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material. Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden. So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously. And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.

RADDATZ: OK, we’re going to move on.

TRUMP: And yet she didn’t know the word — the letter C on a document. Right? She didn’t even know what that word — what that letter meant.

You know, it’s amazing. I’m watching Hillary go over facts. And she’s going after fact after fact, and she’s lying again, because she said she — you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine. You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails? I don’t think so.

She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter’s wedding, number one, and a yoga class. Well, maybe we’ll give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she’s saying there wasn’t anything wrong.

And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasn’t before. That was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And I’ll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.

Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself. What you did — and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.

COOPER: We have to move on.

TRUMP: You did that. Wait a minute. One second.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on.

RADDATZ: We want to give the audience a chance.

TRUMP: If you did that in the private sector, you’d be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond. Then we have to move on to an audience question.

CLINTON: Look, it’s just not true. And so please, go to…

TRUMP: Oh, you didn’t delete them?

COOPER: Allow her to respond, please.

CLINTON: It was personal e-mails, not official.

TRUMP: Oh, 33,000? Yeah.

CLINTON: Not — well, we turned over 35,000, so…

TRUMP: Oh, yeah. What about the other 15,000?

COOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didn’t talk while you talked.

CLINTON: Yes, that’s true, I didn’t.

TRUMP: Because you have nothing to say.

CLINTON: I didn’t in the first debate, and I’m going to try not to in this debate, because I’d like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.

TRUMP: Get off this question.

CLINTON: OK, Donald. I know you’re into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it’s exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you. But let’s at least focus…

TRUMP: Let’s see what happens…

(CROSSTALK)

COOPER: Allow her to respond.

CLINTON: … on some of the issues that people care about tonight. Let’s get to their questions.

COOPER: We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz. He has a question about health care. Ken?

TRUMP: I’d like to know, Anderson, why aren’t you bringing up the e-mails? I’d like to know. Why aren’t you bringing…

COOPER: We brought up the e-mails.

TRUMP: No, it hasn’t. It hasn’t. And it hasn’t been finished at all.

COOPER: Ken Karpowicz has a question.

TRUMP: It’s nice to — one on three.

QUESTION: Thank you. Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable. Premiums have gone up. Deductibles have gone up. Copays have gone up. Prescriptions have gone up. And the coverage has gone down. What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?

COOPER: That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience.

CLINTON: If he wants to start, he can start. No, go ahead, Donald.

TRUMP: No, I’m a gentlemen, Hillary. Go ahead.

(LAUGHTER)

COOPER: Secretary Clinton?

CLINTON: Well, I think Donald was about to say he’s going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I’m going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I’ve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.

But here’s what I don’t want people to forget when we’re talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn’t just that 20 million got insurance who didn’t have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.

But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies can’t deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.

Number three, women can’t be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if you’re under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn’t happen before.

So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act. But we’ve got to get costs down. We’ve got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. And then we would have to start all over again.

Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. That’s the highest we’ve ever been in our country. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, your time is up.

CLINTON: So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.

COOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.

TRUMP: It is such a great question and it’s maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. It’s going up at numbers that nobody’s ever seen worldwide. Nobody’s ever seen numbers like this for health care.

It’s only getting worse. In ’17, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.

Obamacare will never work. It’s very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. It’s going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.

We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want — and President Obama and whoever was working on it — they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition.

You will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you haven’t noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. It’s catastrophic in certain ways.

But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody’s ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you’re never going to be able to use it.

COOPER: Mr. Trump, your time…

TRUMP: It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you. Your husband called Obamacare, quote, “the craziest thing in the world,” saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half. Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?

CLINTON: No, I mean, he clarified what he meant. And it’s very clear. Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. But we have an employer-based system. That’s where the vast majority of people get their health care.

And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn’t put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid. Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn’t have the money to afford insurance and didn’t have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.

That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take. And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance. So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald’s not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies…

COOPER: Secretary Clinton…

CLINTON: … get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I’m sorry, you’ve got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma…

COOPER: Your time is up.

CLINTON: … you may not be able to have insurance because you can’t afford it. So let’s fix what’s broken about it, but let’s not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies. That’s not going to work.

COOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this. TRUMP: Well, I just want — just one thing. First of all, Hillary, everything’s broken about it. Everything. Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment. This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.

COOPER: You’ve said you want to end Obamacare…

TRUMP: By the way…

COOPER: You’ve said you want to end Obamacare. You’ve also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions. How do you force insurance companies to do that if you’re no longer mandating that every American get insurance?

TRUMP: We’re going to be able to. You’re going to have plans…

COOPER: What does that mean?

TRUMP: Well, I’ll tell you what it means. You’re going to have plans that are so good, because we’re going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. Once we break out — once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come…

COOPER: Are you going — are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?

TRUMP: President Obama — Anderson, excuse me. President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said — he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie. President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan. The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn’t work.

But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we’ll also be able to help people that can’t get — don’t have money because we are going to have people protected.

And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way. We’re going to block grant into the states. We’re going to block grant into Medicaid into the states…

COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.

TRUMP: … so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.

COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.

RADDATZ: We now go to Gorbah Hamed with a question for both candidates.

QUESTION: Hi. There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States, and I’m one of them. You’ve mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?

RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, you’re first.

TRUMP: Well, you’re right about Islamophobia, and that’s a shame. But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that — because there is a problem. I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see",0

REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT

AT AFL-CIO LABOR DAY PICNIC

Coney Island

Cincinnati, Ohio

1:24 P.M. EDT

THE PRESIDENT: Hello, Cincinnati! (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, Ohio! (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, labor! (Applause.) All-righty. It is good to be back in Cincinnati. (Applause.) It's good to be back in Ohio. (Applause.) It's good to be back among great friends, great leaders. And I want everybody to give a big round of applause to Charlie Dilbert for that great introduction. (Applause.) And I want to thank Kathy Mattea and the band for the entertainment. Give Kathy a big round of applause. (Applause.)

How you all feeling today? (Applause.) Are you fired up? (Applause.) Are you ready to go? (Applause.) I can't think of a better place to be on Labor Day than at America's biggest Labor Day picnic, and with the workers and families of the Cincinnati AFL-CIO. (Applause.)

I'm so proud to be on the stage with Charlie, because Charlie reminds us that in these tough times, America's working men and women are ready to roll up their sleeves and get back to work. (Applause.)

I want to salute your local AFL-CIO local leaders: Executive Secretary-Treasurer Doug Sizemore -- (applause) -- President Joe Zimmer -- (applause) -- State President Joe Rugola. And your outstanding national leaders: a man who we thank for devoting his life to working Americans -- President John Sweeney. (Applause.) He's right there. And the man who will pick up the mantle, who will take the baton of leadership, who we need to succeed because a strong labor movement is part of a strong economy -- is part of a strong economy -- Secretary-Treasurer Rich Trumka. (Applause.)

Although Ohio's wonderful governor and great friend of mine Ted Strickland couldn't be here, we've got Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher in the house -- (applause) -- Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner -- (applause) -- Attorney General Richard Cordray -- (applause) -- Cincinnati Mayor Mark Mallory -- (applause) -- Hamilton County Commissioner -- Commission President David Pepper. (Applause.)

We're joined by members of Ohio's outstanding congressional delegation: Congressman Steve Driehaus -- (applause) -- and a great friend who is at the forefront of every fight for Ohio's working men and women, including the battle for health insurance reform, Senator Sherrod Brown. (Applause.)

I'm also proud to be here with a leader who is reenergizing the Department of Labor, who realizes that it's not the Department of Management, it's the Department of Labor -- (applause) -- a daughter of union members, a daughter of a Teamster -- Secretary Hilda Solis. (Applause.) My director of recovery for auto communities and workers, Ed Montgomery, is in the house, and he's doing outstanding work. (Applause.)

Now, Cincinnati, like a lot of Americans, you're having some fun today. Taking the day off. Spending time with the kids. Some of you may be proud of your grilling skills. (Laughter.) Every man thinks he can grill -- (laughter) -- whether he can or not. That's what Michelle says. (Laughter.) Michelle says she's a better griller than me. (Applause.) I don't know. We'll have to have a grill-off someday. But you're enjoying some good music, some good food, some famous Cincinnati chili. (Applause.)

But today we also pause. We pause to remember and to reflect and to reaffirm. We remember that the rights and benefits we enjoy today weren't simply handed to America's working men and women. They had to be won. They had to be fought for, by men and women of courage and conviction, from the factory floors of the Industrial Revolution to the shopping aisles of today's superstores. They stood up and they spoke out to demand a fair shake and an honest day's pay for an honest day's work. (Applause.)

Many risked their lives. Some gave their lives. Some made it a cause of their lives -- like Senator Ted Kennedy, who we remember today. (Applause.)

So let us never forget: much of what we take for granted -- the 40-hour work week, the minimum wage, health insurance, paid leave, pensions, Social Security, Medicare -- they all bear the union label. (Applause.) It was the American worker -- men and women just like you -- who returned from World War II to make our economy the envy of the world. It was labor that helped build the largest middle class in history. Even if you're not a union member, every American owes something to America's labor movement. (Applause.)

So as we remember this history, let's reflect on its meaning in our own time. Like so many Americans, you work hard. You meet your responsibilities. You play by the rules. You pay your bills. But in recent years, the American Dream seems like it's been slipping away, because from Washington to Wall Street, too often a different attitude prevailed. Wealth was valued over work, selfishness over sacrifice, greed over responsibility. The right to organize was undermined rather than strengthened. (Applause.)

That's what we saw. And it may have worked out well for those folks at the top, but it didn't work out for you and it didn't work out well for our country. That culture -- that culture and the policies that flowed from it -- undermined the middle class and helped create the greatest economic crisis of our time.

So today, on this Labor Day, we reaffirm our commitment. To rebuild. To live up to the legacy of those who came before us. To combine the enduring values that have served us so well for so long -- hard work and responsibility -- with new ideas for a new century. To ensure that our great middle class remains the backbone of our economy -- not just a vanishing ideal we celebrate at picnics once a year as summer turns to fall. We want it a reality for the families of Ohio and the families of America. (Applause.)

That's what we've been working to do ever since I took office. Now, I notice some people have already forgotten how bad it was just seven months ago. You notice that? They've got sort of selective amnesia. (Laughter.) So let's just remind them for a second. (Applause.) A financial system on the verge of collapse; about 700,000 workers losing their jobs each month; the worst recession of our lifetimes threatening to become another Great Depression.

That's what was happening just seven months ago. And that's why we took bold, swift action. That's why we passed an unprecedented Recovery Act, and we did it without the usual Washington earmarks and pork-barrel spending. And, Ohio, it is working. (Applause.)

Times -- times are still tough. Times are still tough, I know that. But we have given 95 percent of America's working families a tax cut -- 4.5 million families in Ohio, including here in Cincinnati -- a promise we made during the campaign; a promise I kept as President of the United States. (Applause.)

We cut taxes for small businesses, made new loans to more than 1,000 small businesses in Ohio so they could grow and hire more workers. We extended unemployment benefits for 12 million Americans, including Charlie and nearly 570,000 Ohio citizens. (Applause.) Across America, we've saved the jobs of tens of thousands of state and local workers, including teachers and first responders right here in Ohio. Don't take my word for it. Ask folks here in Ohio what they would have done if we hadn't passed the Recovery Act -- the cuts they would have had to make, the taxes they would have had to raise.

We're rebuilding America's infrastructure, including improvements to I-75 in Hamilton County, led by a local Cincinnati contractor. (Applause.) We've got more than 200 other highway projects across Ohio, and we're making a historic commitment to innovation -- much of it still to come in the months and years ahead: doubling our capacity to generate renewable energy; building a new smart grid to carry electricity from coast to coast; laying down broadband lines and high-speed rail lines and providing the largest boost in basic research in our history -- all of which will put people back to work. (Applause.) Steelworkers, plumbers, pipe-fitters, engineers, you name it.

So our recovery plan is working.

Q What about bricklayers?

THE PRESIDENT: Bricklayers, too. (Applause.) The financial system -- financial system has been saved from collapse. Home sales are up. We're seeing signs of life in the auto industry. Business investment is starting to stabilize. For the first time in 18 months, we're seeing growth in manufacturing. When was the last time you heard that here in the United States of America? (Applause.)

Now, on Friday, we learned that the economy lost another 216,000 jobs in August. And whenever Americans are losing jobs, that's simply unacceptable. But for the second straight month, we lost fewer jobs than the month before, and it was the fewest jobs that we had lost in a year. (Applause.) So, make no mistake, we're moving in the right direction. We're on the road to recovery, Ohio. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise. (Applause.)

AUDIENCE: Yes we can! Yes we can! Yes we can!

THE PRESIDENT: Yes we will. Yes we are.

AUDIENCE: Yes we will! Yes we will! Yes we will!

THE PRESIDENT: But -- but, my friends, we still have got a long way to go. We're not going to rest. We're not going to let up. Not until workers looking for jobs can find them -- good jobs that sustain families and sustain dreams. Not until responsible mortgage-owners can stay in their homes. Not until we've got a full economic recovery and all Americans have their shot at the American Dream. (Applause.)

Now, we can't do that if we go back to that old economy -- overleveraged banks, inflated profits, maxed-out credit cards, CEOs and bankers getting multimillion-dollar bonuses --

AUDIENCE: Booo!

THE PRESIDENT: -- an economy of bubbles and bursts, your wages and incomes stagnant while corporate profits soar. So even as we recover from the recession and work to cut the deficit, we have to build a new foundation for prosperity:

We need an America with a reformed financial system. We got to have regulations in place that protect consumers so that we never have a crisis like this again. (Applause.) I don't want to have to bail out any more banks. (Applause.) And we got to make sure we've got regulations in place to prevent it. (Applause.)

An America where energy reform creates green jobs that can never be outsourced and that finally frees America from the grip of foreign oil. (Applause.)

An America that commits to education because the countries that out-educate us today will out-compete us tomorrow and the best jobs will go to the best educated. (Applause.) So we got to do a better job educating our sons and our daughters. And, yes, I'm going to have something to say tomorrow to our children, telling them to stay in school and work hard -- because that's the right message to send. (Applause.)

We need an America that once again invests in the middle class, which is why I've created our task force for middle-class working families, led by my outstanding Vice President Joe Biden to make sure that our policies always benefit you, the American worker. (Applause.)

Today we're taking another step. I'm naming Ron Bloom, who's right here -- raise your hand, Ron; he's right down in the front here. (Applause.) I'm naming Ron Bloom to lead our efforts to revitalize the sector that helped build the middle class: American manufacturing. (Applause.) Ron has worked with steelworkers, service employees, and management to create jobs. He helped guide our auto task force. And as my new point person on manufacturing, he's going to help us craft the policies that will create the next generation of great manufacturing jobs and ensure American competitiveness in the 21st century. (Applause.)

Oh, and by the way, just in case you were wondering, we're also going to build an America where health reform delivers more stability and security to every American. (Applause.) We are going to reform the system for those who have insurance and those who don't. Now, I'll have a lot more to say about this on Wednesday night. I might have to save my voice a little bit -- not get too excited. I don't want to give anything away. I want you all to tune in.

But let me just say a few things about this health care issue. We've been fighting for quality, affordable health care for every American for nearly a century -- since Teddy Roosevelt. Think about that -- long time. (Laughter.) The Congress and the country have now been vigorously debating the issue for many months. The debate has been good, and that's important because we've got to get this right. But every debate at some point comes to an end. At some point, it's time to decide. At some point, it's time to act. Ohio, it's time to act and get this thing done. (Applause.)

We have never been this close. We've never had such broad agreement on what needs to be done. And because we're so close to real reform, suddenly the special interests are doing what they always do, which is just try to scare the heck out of people.

But I've got -- I've got a question for all these folks who say, you know, we're going to pull the plug on Grandma and this is all about illegal immigrants -- you've heard all the lies. I've got a question for all those folks: What are you going to do? (Applause.) What's your answer? (Applause.) What's your solution? (Applause.) And you know what? They don't have one. (Applause.) Their answer is to do nothing. Their answer is to do nothing. And we know what that future looks like: insurance companies raking in the profits while discriminating against people because of preexisting conditions; denying or dropping coverage when you get sick. It means you're never negotiating about higher wages, because all you're spending your time doing is just trying to protect the benefits that you already fought for.

It means premiums continuing to skyrocket three times faster than your wages. It means more families pushed into bankruptcy, more businesses cutting more jobs, more Americans losing health insurance -- 14,000 every day. It means more Americans dying every day just because they don't have health insurance.

That's not the future I see for America. I see reform where we bring stability and security to folks who have insurance today -- where you never again have to worry about going without coverage if you lose your job or you change your job or you get sick. You've got coverage there for you. Where there is a cap on your out-of-pocket expenses, so you don't have to worry that a serious illness will break you and your family even if you have health insurance. (Applause.) Where you never again have to worry -- where you never again have to worry that you or someone you love will be denied coverage because of a preexisting condition. (Applause.)

I see reform where Americans and small businesses that are shut out of health insurance today will be able to purchase coverage at a price they can afford. (Applause.) Where they'll be able to shop and compare in a new health insurance exchange -- a marketplace where competition and choice will continue to hold down costs and help deliver them a better deal. And I continue to believe that a public option within that basket of insurance choices will help improve quality and bring down costs. (Applause.)

I see reform where we protect our senior citizens by closing the gaps in their prescription drug coverage under Medicare that costs older Americans thousands of dollars every years out of their pockets; reforms that will preserve Medicare and put it on a sounder financial footing and cut waste and fraud -- the more than $100 billion in unwarranted public subsidies to already profitable insurance companies.

I want a health insurance system that works as well for the American people as it does for the insurance industry. (Applause.) They should be free to make a profit. But they also have to be fair. They also have to be accountable.

That's what we're talking about -- security and stability for folks who have health insurance, help for those they don't -- the coverage they need at a price they can afford, finally bringing costs under control. That's the reform that's needed. That's the reform we're fighting for. And that's why it's time to do what's right for America's working families and put aside partisanship, stop saying things that aren't true, come together as a nation, pass health insurance reform now -- this year. (Applause.)

Few have fought harder or longer for health care in America's workers than you -- our brothers and sisters of organized labor. And just as we know that we have to adapt to all the changes and challenges of a global economy, we also know this: In good economic times and in bad, labor is not the problem. Labor is part of the solution. (Applause.)

That's why Secretary Solis made it her priority at the Labor Department to protect workers -- your safety, your benefits, your right to organize, your right to bargain collectively. (Applause.) That's why some of the first executive orders I issued overturned the previous administration's attempts to stifle organized labor. That's why I support EFCA -- to level the playing field so it's easier for employees who want a union to form a union. (Applause.) Nothing -- nothing wrong with that. Because when labor is strong, America is strong. When we all stand together, we all rise together. (Applause.)

That's why the first piece of legislation I signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act -- (applause) -- guaranteeing equal pay for equal work. (Applause.) Lilly worked at a factory in Alabama. She did her job and she did it well. And then, after nearly two decades, she discovered that for years she was paid less than her male colleagues for doing the very same work. Over the years, she had lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in wages and in pension and Social Security benefits.

Lilly could have just moved on. Instead, this Alabama grandmother made a decision. She said a principle was at stake. She stood up and she spoke out for what was right -- all the way to the Supreme Court, and then Congress, and finally the White House, where she stood next to me as I signed the law that bore her name. (Applause.)

Ohio, that's the lesson this day -- that some things are worth fighting for. (Applause.) Equal pay. Fair wages. Dignity in the workplace. Justice on the job. An economy that works for everybody, because in America there are no second-class citizens. An economy where you can make a living and care for your families. Where you're leaving your kids something better. Where we live up to our fundamental ideals. Those words put on paper some 200 years ago -- that we're all created equal, that we all deserve a chance to pursue our happiness -- that's the calling to which we are summoned this Labor Day. That's the cause of my presidency. And that is the commitment we must fulfill to preserve the American Dream for all of America's working families.

But I'm going to need you to do it. At the beginning of this speech, I talked about whether you were fired up. (Applause.) I know that, over the last couple months, the economy has been bad, the recession has been wearing on folks -- people losing their jobs, people losing their health care, people losing their homes in some cases. It's been the usual bickering in Washington. Doesn't seem like that ever stops. Pundits on TV, they're saying how, oh, this isn't working and that's not working. You know, you start getting into a funk, and whenever I see folks in that negative place, I always think back to a story I told during the campaign. Some of you have heard it. But I just thought I'd say it again. (Applause.)

It's about where the phrase ""fired up"" comes from. So, this is when we were -- right at the beginning of the campaign for the presidency, nobody gave us a chance -- none of you all could pronounce my name. (Laughter.) And I went down to South Carolina. I went down -- I think I was -- where was I? (Laughter.) I was in Greenville -- am I right? Greenville. And the legislators were having a little banquet and they had invited me to come down to speak. And I sat next to a state representative. I had nobody supporting me back then, so I had to ask everybody. I said, will you support my campaign for the presidency of the United States? And this state rep looked me up and down and she said, ""You know, I will give you my endorsement if you come to my hometown at Greenwood, South Carolina.""

Now, I had had a glass of wine, so I said right away, I said, okay. (Laughter.) Let's shake on it. Come to find out that Greenwood is about an hour and a half from everyplace else. (Laughter.)

So about a month later, I fly in -- I've been campaigning for two weeks straight, haven't seen my family, I'm exhausted, I'm tired. Get to the hotel room, I'm dragging my bag into my room, about to go to bed. I get a tap on my shoulder. It's my staff member, says, ""Excuse me, sir."" I said, ""What?"" (Laughter.) He said, ""You have to be in the car tomorrow at 6:30 a.m. in the morning. I said, ""Why?"" (Laughter.) He said, ""Because we got to go to Greenwood like you promised."" (Laughter.)

So the next day, I wake up and I feel worse than when I went to bed. I stagger over the window, open up the blinds -- it's pouring down rain outside; ugly day. I go out, get my newspaper, open it up, there's a bad story about me in The New York Times. I pack up my stuff, I go downstairs. My umbrella breaks and I get soaked. So that by the time I'm in the car, I'm sleepy, I'm wet, and I'm mad. (Laughter.) And we start driving, and we just keep on driving -- we're driving, we're driving, we drive -- goes on forever. Hour and a half we're driving.

Finally we get to Greenwood -- although you don't know that you're in Greenwood right away. (Laughter.) It's kind of -- a lot of fields and -- (laughter.) We pull up next to a little field house in a park and I get back out and I get a little more wet and I go inside. And after this hour-and-a-half drive, lo and behold, there are only 20 people inside. (Laughter.) And most of them are wet and don't look like they really want to be there either. (Laughter.)

So, you know, I'm a professional. I go and shake everybody's hands and I've got kind of a tight smile on my face. ""How do you do? What do you do? Nice to meet you."" Suddenly I hear this voice behind me, shouting out -- ""Fired up?"" And I'm surprised. I'm scared, almost. (Laughter.) But everybody else acts like this was normal and they all say, ""Fired up!"" ""Ready to go?"" People around me, they all say, ""Ready to go!""

I don't know what's going on. I look behind me. There is a little woman. She couldn't be more than 5'2"". Watch out -- you're little, too. (Laughter.) Little lady. She's about 50, 60 years old. She dressed like she just came from church. She got a big church hat. And she's smiling at me. She looks at me and she says, ""Fired up!""

Turns out this woman is a city council member from Greenwood who is famous for her chant. Every event she goes to, she likes chanting. She goes, ""Fired up? ""Fired up!"" ""Ready to go?"" ""Ready to go!"" And she does a little dance while she's doing it. (Laughter.)

So for the next five minutes, it seems like, she just keeps on saying this little chant. ""Fired up?"" ""Fired up!"" ""Ready to go?"" ""Ready to go!"" And I'm standing there and I'm thinking, this woman is upstaging me. (Laughter.) I don't know what to do. I'm looking at my staff. I'm thinking, when is this thing going to be over? (Laughter.)

But here's the thing, Ohio. After about a minute or two, I'm starting to feel kind of fired up. (Laughter and applause.) I'm starting to feel like I'm ready to go. (Applause.) So I start joining in the chant, and it's making me feel good. And for the rest of the day, whenever -- we campaigned the whole day. Whenever I saw my staff, I said, ""Are you fired up?"" They said, ""I'm fired up, boss. Are you ready to go?"" And I'd say, ""I'm ready to go.""

It just goes to show you how one voice can change a room. (Applause.) And if it can change a room, it can change a city. (Applause.) And if it can change a city, it can change a state. (Applause.) And if it can change a state, it can change a nation. (Applause.) And if it can change a nation, it can change the world. (Applause.) Your voice can change the world. Your voice will get health care passed. Your voice will make sure that the American worker is protected. You can build America. I need your help.

Thank you, Cincinnati. Are you fired up?

AUDIENCE: Fired up!

THE PRESIDENT: Ready to go?

AUDIENCE: Ready to go!

AUDIENCE: Fired up!

THE PRESIDENT: Ready to go?

AUDIENCE: Ready to go!

THE PRESIDENT: Fired up?

politifact14205,"Bin Laden is “Alive and well in the Bahamas”, says Edward SnowdenMoscow | National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden has made a new controversial claim yesterday, saying that he possessed some classified information proving that Osama Bin Laden is still alive.

Snowden, who lives as a fugitive in Russia after leaking documents about the NSA’s surveillance programs has made some previously unreported allegations about the famous terrorist, Osama Bin Laden, during an interview with the Moscow Tribune.

According to him, not only is Bin Laden still alive, but he is living a lavish lifestyle in the Bahamas, thanks to regular payments from the CIA.

“I have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIA’s payroll,” claims Edward Snowden. “He is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2016, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.”

Mr. Snowden says the CIA orchestrated the fake death of the former leader of Al Qaeda, while he was actually transported with his family to an undisclosed location in the Bahamas.

“Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIA’s most efficient operatives for a long time,” claims the famous whistleblower. “What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody’s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.”

Mr. Snowden says that the documents proving that Bin Laden is still alive will be integrally reproduced in his new book, expected to be released in September.

Edward Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor in 2013 after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. In the month of June of the same year, he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists.

The US government filed espionage charges against him shortly after his revelations were made public. He has been living under asylum in Moscow, after fleeing the US for Hong Kong in the wake of the leaks.

On July 28, 2015, the White House has rejected a “We the People” petition of nearly 168,000 signatories, to pardon him.",1
politifact5868,"REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY AT A CAMPAIGN EVENT1:05 P.M. EDT

MRS. OBAMA: Oh, wow. (Applause.) Wow. It sounds like you all are already fired up and ready to go. (Applause.) This is amazing. It is truly amazing. And you know what, being here with all of you today, let me tell you, I'm feeling pretty fired up and ready to go myself. I really am. (Applause.)

But there’s a reason why we're here today --

AUDIENCE: I love you! (Applause.)

MRS. OBAMA: And we love you, too. And it's not just because we support one extraordinary man -- although, I'll admit, I'm a little biased because I think our President is awesome. (Laughter and applause.)

And it's not just because we want to win an election. We are here because of the values we believe in. We're here because of the vision for this country that we all share. We're here because we want all our children to have a good education, right? (Applause.) Schools that push them and inspire them, prepare them for good jobs. We want our parents and our grandparents to retire with dignity -- (applause) -- because we believe that after a lifetime of hard work, they should enjoy their golden years.

We want to restore that basic middle-class security for our families because we believe that folks shouldn't go bankrupt because they get sick. (Applause.) They shouldn't lose their home because someone loses a job. We believe that responsibility should be rewarded and hard work should pay off.

And truly, these are basic American values. They're the same values that so many of us were raised with, including myself. You see, my father was a blue-collar city worker at the city water plant. And my family lived in a little bitty apartment on the South Side of Chicago. And neither of my parents had the chance to go to college. But let me tell you what my parents did do: They saved. They sacrificed. I mean, they poured everything they had into me and my brother. They wanted us to have the kind of education they could only dream of. And while pretty much all of my college tuition came from student loans and grants, my dad still paid a little bitty portion of that tuition himself. And let me tell you, every semester, my dad was determined to pay that bill right on time because he was so proud to be sending his kids to college. (Applause.)

And he couldn't bear the thought of me or my brother missing that registration deadline because his check was late. Like so many people in this country, my father took great pride in being able to earn a living that allowed him to handle his responsibility to his family, to pay all of his bills and to pay them on time.

And truly, more than anything else, that is what's at stake. It's that fundamental promise that no matter who you are or how you started out, if you work hard, you can build a decent life for yourself and yes, an even better life for your kids. (Applause.)

And it is that promise that binds us together as Americans. It's what makes us who we are. And whether it's equal pay for women, or health care for our kids; whether it's tax cuts for middle-class families or student loans for our young people -- (applause) -- that is what my husband has been fighting for every single day as President. Every single day. (Applause.)

And let me tell you something -- as First Lady, I have had the chance to see up close and personal what being President looks like, right? I have seen how the issues that come across the President’s desk are always the hard ones.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: You’re beautiful, Michelle! (Applause.)

MRS. OBAMA: But in all seriousness -- (laughter) -- these problems, they’re always the hard ones -- the problems with no clear solutions, the judgment calls where the stakes are so high and there is no margin for error. And as President, you can get all kinds of advice from all kinds of people. But at the end of the day, when it comes time to make that decision, all you have to guide you are your life experiences, your values, and your vision for this country. That’s all you have. In the end, when you’re making those impossible choices, it all boils down to who you are and what you stand for.

And we all know what Barack Obama is -- who he is. (Applause.) We all know what our President stands for, right? (Applause.) He is the son of a single mother who struggled to put herself through school and pay the bills. That’s who he is. He’s the grandson of a woman who woke up before dawn every day to catch a bus to her job at the bank. And even though Barack’s grandmother worked hard to help support his family, she was good at her job. Like so many women, she hit that glass ceiling. And men no more qualified than she was were promoted up the ladder ahead of her.

So believe me, Barack knows what it means when a family struggles. He knows what it means when someone doesn’t have a chance to fulfill their potential. And what you need to know, America -- those are the experiences that have made him the man and the President he is today. (Applause.)

But I have said this before and will say it again and again: Barack cannot do this alone. And fortunately, he never has. We have always moved this country forward together. And today, more than ever before, Barack needs your help. He needs your help. He needs your help. (Applause.) He needs every single one of you -- every single one of you to give just a little part of your life each week to this campaign.

He needs you to register those voters. (Applause.) And to all of the college students out there, all of you -- if you're going to be moving over the summer, remember to register at your new address in the fall. You got that? Get that done. (Applause.)

Barack needs you to join one of our neighborhood teams and start organizing in your community. And just let me say, if there have ever been any doubt about the difference that you can make, I just want you to remember that in the end, this all could come down to those few thousand people who register to vote. Think about it. It could all come down to those last few thousand folks who get out to the polls on November the 6th.

And when you average that out over this entire state, it might mean registering just one more person in your town. It might mean helping just one more person in your community get out and vote on Election Day. So know this: With every door you knock on, with every call you make, with every conversation you have, I want you to remember that this could be the one that makes the difference. This could be the one. (Applause.) Remember that. That is exactly the kind of impact that each of you can have.

Now, I am not going to kid you. This journey is going to be long. And it is going to be hard. But know that that is how change always happens in this country. And if we keep showing up, if we keep fighting the good fight, then eventually we get there. We always do. Maybe not in our lifetimes, but maybe in our children's lifetimes, maybe in our grandchildren's lifetimes -- because in the end, that's what this is all about.

That is what I think about when I tuck my girls in at night. I think about the world I want to leave for them and for all of our sons and our daughters. I think about how I want to do for them what my dad did for me. I want to give them a foundation for their dreams. (Applause.) I want to give them opportunities worthy of their promise. I want to give them that sense of limitless possibility, that belief that here in America, there is always something better out there if you're willing to work for it. So we just cannot turn back now, right?

AUDIENCE: No!

MRS. OBAMA: We have come so far, but we have so much more to do. And if we want to keep on moving forward then we need to work our hearts out for the man that I have the pleasure of introducing here today. (Applause.) Are you ready?

It is my privilege to introduce my husband and our President, President Barack Obama!

THE PRESIDENT: Hello, Ohio! (Applause.) It is good to be back in Ohio! (Applause.) Right before I came out, somebody happened to give me a buckeye for good luck. (Applause.)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you!

THE PRESIDENT: I love you back! Now, before I begin, I want to say thank you to a few people who are joining us here today. Your mayor, Michael Coleman is here. (Applause.) Former Governor Ted Strickland is here. (Applause.) Senator Sherrod Brown is in the house. (Applause.) An American hero, John Glenn is with us. (Applause.)

And I want to thank so many of our Neighborhood Team Leaders for being here today. You guys will be the backbone of this campaign. (Applause.) And I want the rest of you to join a team or become a leader yourself, because we are going to win this thing the old-fashioned way -- door by door, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood. (Applause.)

Ohio, four years ago, you and I began a journey together.

I didn’t run, and you didn’t work your hearts out, just to win an election. We came together to reclaim the basic bargain that built the largest middle class and the most prosperous nation on Earth.

We came together because we believe that in America, your success shouldn’t be determined by the circumstances of your birth. If you’re willing to work hard, you should be able to find a good job. If you’re willing to meet your responsibilities, you should be able to own a home, maybe start a business, give your children the chance to do even better -- no matter who you are, or where you come from, or what you look like, or what your last name is. (Applause.)

We believe the free market is one of the greatest forces for progress in human history; that businesses are the engine of growth; that risk-takers and innovators should be rewarded. But we also believe that at its best, the free market has never been a license to take whatever you want, however you can get it; that alongside our entrepreneurial spirit and our rugged individualism, America only prospers when we meet our obligations to one another and to future generations. (Applause.)

We came together in 2008 because our country had strayed from these basic values. A record surplus was squandered on tax cuts for people who didn’t need them and weren’t even asking for them. Two wars were being waged on a credit card. Wall Street speculators reaped huge profits by making bets with other people’s money. Manufacturing left our shores. A shrinking number of Americans did fantastically well, while most people struggled with falling incomes, rising costs, the slowest job growth in half a century.

It was ahouse of cards that collapsed in the most destructive crisis since the Great Depression. In the last six months of 2008, even as we were campaigning, nearly three million of our neighbors lost their jobs. Over 800,000 more were lost in the month I took office alone.

It was tough. But I tell you what, Ohio -- the American people are tougher. (Applause.) All across this country, people like you dug in. Some of you retrained. Some of you went back to school. Small business owners cut back on expenses, but did everything they could to keep their employees. Yes, there were setbacks. Yes, there were disappointments. But we didn’t quit. We don’t quit. Together, we’re fighting our way back. (Applause.)

When some wanted to let Detroit go bankrupt, we made a bet on American workers, on the ingenuity of American companies. And today, our auto industry is back on top of the world. (Applause.) Manufacturers started investing again, adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s. Businesses got back to the basics, exports surged. And over four million jobs were created in the last two years -- more than one million of those in the last six months alone. (Applause.) Are we satisfied?

AUDIENCE: No!

THE PRESIDENT: Of course not. Too many of our friends and family are still out there looking for work. The housing market is still weak, deficits are still too high, and states are still laying off teachers, first responders. This crisis took years to develop, and the economy is still facing headwinds. And it will take sustained, persistent effort -- yours and mine -- for America to fully recover. That’s the truth. We all know it.

But we are making progress. And now we face a choice. (Applause.) Now we face a choice, Ohio.

CHILD: We love you, Barack Obama!

AUDIENCE: Awww --

THE PRESIDENT: (Laughter.) Thank you. Now we face a choice. For the last few years, the Republicans who run this Congress have insisted that we go right back to the policies that created this mess.

AUDIENCE: Booo --

THE PRESIDENT: But to borrow a line from my friend Bill Clinton, now their agenda is on steroids. (Applause.) This time, they want even bigger tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. This time, they want even deeper cuts to things like education and Medicare, and research and technology.

AUDIENCE: Booo --

THE PRESIDENT: This time, they want to give banks and insurance companies even more power to do as they please. And now, after a long and spirited primary, Republicans in Congress have found a nominee for President who has promised to rubber-stamp this agenda if he gets the chance.

AUDIENCE: Booo --

THE PRESIDENT: Ohio, I tell you what: We cannot give him that chance. (Applause.) Not now. Not with so much at stake. This is not just another election. This is a make-or-break moment for the middle class, and we’ve been through too much to turn back now. (Applause.)

AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years!

THE PRESIDENT: We have come too far to abandon the change we fought for these past few years. We have to move forward, to the future we imagined in 2008, where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same rules. (Applause.) That’s the choice in this election, and that’s why I’m running for a second term as President of the United States. (Applause.)

Governor Romney is a patriotic American who has raised a wonderful family, and he has much to be proud of. He’s run a large financial firm, and he’s run a state. But I think he has drawn the wrong lessons from those experiences. He sincerely believes that if CEOs and wealthy investors like him make money, the rest of us will automatically prosper as well.

AUDIENCE: Booo --

THE PRESIDENT: When a woman in Iowa shared the story of her financial struggles, he responded with economic theory. He told her, “our productivity equals our income.” Well, let me tell you something. The problem with our economy isn’t that the American people aren’t productive enough -- you’ve been working harder than ever. (Applause.) The challenge we face right now -- the challenge we faced for over a decade is that harder work hasn’t led to higher incomes. It’s that bigger profits haven’t led to better jobs. (Applause.)

Governor Romney doesn’t seem to get that. He doesn’t seem to understand that maximizing profits by whatever means necessary -- whether through layoffs or outsourcing or tax avoidance or union-busting -- might not always be good for the average American or for the American economy.

Why else would he want to spend trillions more on tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Why else would he propose cutting his own taxes while raising them on 18 million working families? Why else would he want to slash the investments that have always helped the economy grow, but at the same time, stop regulating the reckless behavior on Wall Street that helped the economy crash?

Somehow, he and his friends in Congress think that the same bad ideas will lead to a different result. Or they’re just hoping you won’t remember what happened the last time we tried it their way.

Well, Ohio, I’m here to say that we were there, we remember, and we are not going back. We are moving this country forward. (Applause.)

Look, we want businesses to succeed. We want entrepreneurs and investors rewarded when they take risks, when they create jobs and grow our economy. But the true measure of our prosperity is more than just a running tally of every balance sheet and quarterly profit report. I don’t care how many ways you try to explain it: Corporations aren’t people. People are people. (Applause.)

We measure prosperity not just by our total GDP; not just by how many billionaires we produce, but how well the typical family is doing -- whether they can go as far as their dreams and hard work will take them.

And we understand that in this country, people succeed when they have a chance to get a decent education and learn new skills -- and, by the way, so do the businesses that hire them or the companies that they start. (Applause.)

We know that our economy grows when we support research into medical breakthroughs and new technologies that lead to the next Internet app or life-saving drug.

We know that our country is stronger when we can count on affordable health insurance and Medicare and Social Security. (Applause.) When we protect our kids from toxic dumping and mercury pollution. When there are rules to make sure we aren’t taken advantage of by credit card companies and mortgage lenders and financial institutions. And we know these rules aren’t just good for seniors, or kids, or consumers -- they're good for business, too. They're part of what makes the market work.

Look, we don’t expect government to solve all our problems, and it shouldn’t try. I learned from my mom that no education policy can take the place of a parent’s love and affection. (Applause.) As a young man, I worked with a group of Catholic churches who taught me that no poverty program can make as much of a difference as the kindness and commitment of a caring soul. (Applause.) Not every regulation is smart. Not every tax dollar is spent wisely. Not every person can be helped who refuses to help themselves.

But that’s not an excuse to tell the vast majority of responsible, hardworking Americans, “You’re on your own.” That unless you’re lucky enough to have parents who can lend you money, you may not be able to go to college. That even if you pay your premiums every month, you’re out of luck if an insurance company decides to drop your coverage when you need it most.

That’s not how we built America. That’s not who we are. We built this country together. (Applause.) We built this country together.

We built railroads and highways; the Hoover Dam, the Golden Gate Bridge -- together. We sent my grandfather’s generation to college on the GI Bill -- together. We instituted a minimum wage and worker safety laws -- together. Together, we touched the surface of the moon, unlocked the mystery of the atom, connected the world through our own science and imagination. We did these things together -- not because they benefited any particular individual or group, but because they made us all richer. Because they gave us all opportunity. Because they moved us forward together -- as one people, as one nation. (Applause.)

That’s the true lesson of our past, Ohio. That’s the right vision for our future. And that’s why I’m running for President. (Applause.)

I’m running to make sure that by the end of the decade, more of our citizens hold a college degree than any other nation on Earth. (Applause.) I want to help our schools hire and reward the best teachers, especially in math and science. (Applause.) I want to give two million more Americans the chance to go to community colleges and learn the skills that local businesses are looking for right now. In the 21st century, higher education can’t be a luxury -- it is an economic imperative that every American should be able to afford. That’s the choice in this election. That’s why I’m running for President. (Applause.)

I’m running to make sure the next generation of high-tech manufacturing takes root in places like Columbus and Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Richmond. I want to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs and profits overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in the United States of America. That’s the choice in this election. (Applause.)

I’m running so that we can keep moving towards a future where we control our own energy. Our dependence on foreign oil is at its lowest point in 16 years. (Applause.) By the middle of the next decade, our cars will average nearly 55 miles per gallon. Thousands of Americans have jobs, right now, because the production of renewal energy in this country has nearly doubled in just three years. (Applause.)

So now is not the time to cut these investments to pay for another $4 billion giveaway to the oil companies. Now is the time to end the subsidies for an industry that’s rarely been more profitable. (Applause.) Let’s double down on a clean energy future that’s never been more promising -- for our economy, and for our security, and for the safety of our planet. That’s why I’m running for President. That’s the choice in this election, Ohio. (Applause.)

AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years!

THE PRESIDENT: For the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq. (Applause.) Osama bin Laden is no longer a threat to this country. (Applause.) Al Qaeda is on the path to defeat. And by 2014, the war in Afghanistan will be over. (Applause.)

America is safer and more respected because of the courage and selflessness of the United States Armed Forces. (Applause.) And as long as I’m Commander-in-Chief, this country will care for our veterans and serve our veterans as well as they’ve served us -- (applause) -- because nobody who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home. (Applause.)

My opponent said it was “tragic” to end the war in Iraq. He said he won’t set a timeline for ending the war in Afghanistan.

AUDIENCE: Booo --

THE PRESIDENT: I have, and I intend to keep it. (Applause.) After a decade of war that’s cost us thousands of lives and over a trillion dollars, the nation we need to build is our own. (Applause.) I will use half of what we’re no longer spending on war to pay down the deficit, and the other half to repair our roads and our bridges, our runways and our wireless networks. That’s the choice in this election -- to rebuild America. (Applause.)

I’m running to pay down our debt in a way that’s balanced and responsible. After inheriting a $1 trillion deficit, I signed $2 trillion of spending cuts into law. And now I want to finish the job by streamlining government and cutting more waste, and reforming our tax code so that it is simpler and fairer, and asks the wealthiest Americans to pay a little bit more. (Applause.)

My opponent won’t tell us how he’d pay for his new,

$5 trillion tax cut -- a tax cut that gives an average of $250,000 to every millionaire in this country.

AUDIENCE: Booo --

THE PRESIDENT: But we know the bill for that tax cut will either be passed on to our children, or it will be paid for by a whole lot of ordinary Americans. That’s what we know. And I refuse to let that happen again. (Applause.)

I refuse to pay for another millionaire’s tax cut by eliminating medical research projects into things like cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. I refuse to pay for another tax cut by kicking children off of Head Start programs; or asking students to pay more for college; or eliminating health insurance for millions of poor and elderly and disabled Americans on Medicaid. (Applause.)

And as long as I’m President of the United States, I will never allow Medicare to be turned into a voucher that would end the program as we know it. (Applause.) We will not go back to the days when our citizens spent their golden years at the mercy of private insurance companies. We will reform Medicare -- not by shifting the cost of care to seniors, but by reducing the spending that isn’t making people healthier. (Applause.) That’s what’s at stake in this election. That’s what’s at stake, Ohio.

On issue after issue, we can’t afford to spend the next four years going backward. America doesn’t need to refight the battles we just had over Wall Street reform and health care reform. On health care reform, here is what I know: Allowing 2.5 million young people to stay on their parents’ health insurance plan -- that was the right thing to do. (Applause.) Cutting prescription drug costs for seniors -- that was the right thing to do. (Applause.) I will not go back to the days when insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, or deny you coverage, or charge women differently from men. We’re not going back there. We’re going forward. (Applause.)

We don’t need another political fight about ending a woman’s right to choose, or getting rid of Planned Parenthood -- (applause) -- or taking away access to affordable birth control. I want women to control their own health choices, just like I want my daughters to have the same opportunities as your sons. (Applause.) We are not turning back the clock. We are moving forward. (Applause.)

We’re not returning to the days when you could be kicked out of the United States military just because of who you are or who you love. (Applause.) That would be wrong for our national security, and it would be a betrayal of our values.

This should be the last election where multimillion-dollar donations speak louder than the voices of ordinary citizens. (Applause.) We need more checks on lobbyists and special interests, not less.

We’re not going to eliminate the EPA. We’re not going to roll back the bargaining rights that generations of workers fought for. (Applause.) It’s time to stop denying citizenship to responsible young people just because they’re the children of undocumented immigrants. (Applause.) This country is at its best when we harness the God-given talents of every individual; when we hear every voice; when we come together as one American family, striving for the same dream.

That’s what we’re fighting for. That's what we're fighting for, Ohio. A bold America. A competitive America. A generous America. A forward-looking America, where everybody has a chance to make of their life what they will. That’s what made us the envy of the world. That’s what makes us great. That’s why I’m running again for President of the United States. (Applause.)

AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years!

THE PRESIDENT: And that is why I need your help. Ohio, this election will be even closer than the last. Too many of our friends, too many of our neighbors are still hurting because of this crisis. I've heard from too many people wondering why they haven't been able to get one of the jobs that have been created; why their home is still under water; why their family hasn't yet been touched by the recovery.

The other side won't be offering these Americans a real answer to these questions. They won't offer a better vision or a new set of ideas. But they will be spending more money than we've ever seen before on negative ads, on TV, on radio, in the mail, on the Internet -- ads that exploit people's frustrations for my opponent's political gain. Over and over again, they will tell you that America is down and out, and they'll tell you who to blame, and ask if you’re better off than you were before the worst crisis in our lifetime.

We’ve seen that play before. But you know what? The real question -- the question that will actually make a difference in your life and in the lives of your children -- is not just about how we’re doing today. It’s about how we’ll be doing tomorrow.

Will we better off if more Americans get a better education? That’s the question. Will we better off if we depend less on foreign oil and more on our own ingenuity? That's the question. (Applause.) Will we better off if we start doing some nation-building right here at home? That's the question. Will we be better off if we bring down our deficit without gutting the very things we need to grow? When we look back four years from now, or ten years from now, or twenty years from now, won’t we be better off if we have the courage to keep moving forward? (Applause.)

That’s the question in this election. That's the question in this election. And the outcome is entirely up to you. Now, sure, we’ll have to contend with even more negative ads, with even more cynicism and nastiness, and sometimes just plain foolishness. There will be more of that than we saw in the last campaign.

But if there is one thing that we learned in 2008, it’s that nothing is more powerful than millions of voices calling for change. (Applause.) When enough of you knock on doors, when you pick up phones, when you talk to your friends, when you decide that it’s time for change to happen, guess what? Change happens. Change comes to America. (Applause.)

And that’s the spirit we need again. If people ask you what this campaign is about, you tell them it’s still about hope. You tell them it’s still about change. You tell them it’s still about ordinary people who believe that in the face of great odds, we can make a difference in the life of this country. (Applause.)

Because I still believe, Ohio. I still believe that we are not as divided as our politics suggest. I still believe that we have more in common than the pundits tell us; that we're not Democrats or Republicans, but Americans first and foremost. (Applause.) I still believe in you, and I’m asking you to keep believing in me. (Applause.) I told you in 2008 that I wasn’t a perfect man, and I would never be a perfect President. But I promised that I would always tell you what I thought. I would always tell you where I stood. And I would wake up every single day fighting for you as hard as I know how. (Applause.)

And I have that kept that promise. I have kept that promise, Ohio. And I will keep it so long as I have the honor of being your President. So if you’re willing to stick with me, if you're willing to fight with me, and press on with me; if you’re willing to work even harder in this election than you did in the last election, I guarantee you -- we will move this country forward. (Applause.)

We will finish what we started. We are still fired up. We are still ready to go. And we are going to remind the world once more just why it is that the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth. (Applause.)

Thank you, God bless you. God bless the United States of America.

CROSSFIRE

Should U.S. Trust Russia on Syria?

Aired September 10, 2013 - 18:28 ET

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.



ANNOUNCER: Tonight on CROSSFIRE, as President Obama prepares to address the nation, he hits the pause button on attacking Syria. Should he follow Russia's lead or keep threatening a military strike?



JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE: Nothing focuses the mind like the prospect of a hanging.



ANNOUNCER: On the left, Van Jones. On the right, S.E. Cupp. In the CROSSFIRE, Joe Lieberman, who supports the strike on Syria, and Rick Santorum, who's opposed. Is Russia's diplomacy real? Or should the U.S. strike Assad now? Tonight on CROSSFIRE.



VAN JONES, CO-HOST: Welcome to CROSSFIRE. I'm Van Jones on the left.



S.E. CUPP, CO-HOST: I'm S.E. Cupp on the right.



Tonight, the world is giddy at the prospect of getting out of a U.S. military strike on Syria. It's all thanks to Russia's offer of a diplomatic solution, even though it's a phony one. Nevertheless, the president's team is more than happy to take credit for it.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



KERRY: Well, it's the credible threat of force that has been on the table for these last weeks that has, for the first time, brought this regime to even acknowledge that they have a chemical weapons arsenal.



REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER: This is a victory for President Obama, if it is real.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CUPP: Van, it seems like Nancy Pelosi is ready to order the ""mission accomplished"" banner. Look, everyone wants to parachute out of this conflict. I get that. But the Russians have offered us not a parachute but a knapsack. A knapsack that will never open. This is nothing more than a delay tactic.



JONES: Well, I disagree. First of all, I think the world is rightfully happy that we are off the path to war, possibly. The diplomatic option is a good thing. And frankly, everybody is giving John Kerry a hard time. I would rather for us to blunder on the path to peace than to stumble onto the path of war.



CUPP: If this were proposal -- if this proposal were real and offered up by legitimate, good actors, I would be happy to consider it.



JONES: Well, welcome to the real world, where you don't get the chance to pick who offers you a solution to this thing.



Look, we've got two former presidential candidates and two former senators -- both the same person -- tonight on CROSSFIRE to help us with this thing.



RICK SANTORUM (R), FORMER PENNSYLVANIA SENATOR: Two friends, I might add. And two friends.



JONES: And two friends. Republican Rick Santorum is against attacking Syria. Democratic former senator, now independent, Joe Lieberman, he supports the strike.



The first question to you. You've got to be happy now. We've got a big diplomatic opening. You've got to be on President Obama's team now. You're happy, right?



CUPP: Leading question.



SANTORUM: If there's not going to be a military attack, that's a good thing. So if the president is willing to step down for whatever reason, look, he -- he went to the Congress because he didn't want to do this. If he wanted to do it, he'd said he had the power to do it. And he just decided not to.



When you consider the fact that, whether it's on immigration or health care or on DOMA or on a whole variety of things --



JONES: But are you --



SANTORUM: -- he's done things that he doesn't have the power to do. Now he has the power to do something, and he went to Congress. So it's clear he didn't want to do this.



JONES: You're on team Obama now.



SANTORUM: I'm on team ""let's not broaden this war and put a much more complicated diplomatic situation and military situation in the hands of someone who's proved incapable of handling the situation.""



JONES: We'll argue about that later.



CUPP: Senator Lieberman, why after two years and 100,000 people dead, two chemical attacks, two million refugees, why is pausing yet again to dither on this conflict the smart or moral decision?



JOE LIEBERMAN (I), FORMER CONNECTICUT SENATOR: Well, I wish we were not pausing. I mean, I think President Obama made the right moral decision when he drew the red line --



CUPP: Right.



LIEBERMAN: -- and then when he said, after we had proof that chemical weapons were used to kill almost 1,500 innocents, including 426 children by Assad in Syria, that he was going to take military action.



I was really surprised and disappointed when he decided to toss it to Congress. He was right. He had the legal authority to do it himself. I wish he had done it. If he had, I think the American people would have been happy now that he had done it.



CUPP: Should he attack now? Should he attack now without Congress?



LIEBERMAN: I -- well, I think, now that Russia has made this offer, even though it's hard to take it seriously coming from Russia which hasn't been our friend -- just look at the Snowden matter.



CUPP: Right.



LIEBERMAN: Look at Syria, where Assad -- John Kerry said correctly last week that he tried very hard to reach an agreement with Assad years ago as a senator and decided he was a liar.



JONES: But you're not saying we should through this peace offering in the garbage can and then -- and then attack now. Is that what you're saying?



LIEBERMAN: No, I'm saying that it's hard to take the proposal by Russia seriously, but it's important enough that we've got to challenge them to be serious about it and see if Syria really will, with international supervision and penalties, get rid of all their chemical weapons. If they did that, it would be a tremendous accomplishment.



But I think the president still has to face the fact, if nothing happens, that there was a chemical attack --



SANTORUM: The bottom line is here we have no national security interests.



JONES: We don't have any national security interests when children are being chemically --



SANTORUM: Then we should be in Darfur. Then we should be in 50 other countries around the world.



JONES: Hold on.



SANTORUM: That is not --



CUPP: What about --



SANTORUM: That is not a reason.



CUPP: What about al Qaeda?



SANTORUM: I wish -- I wish -- that is the point. The point is we have no set national security interest, because the two sides of this conflict are both enemies of the United States. We have al Qaeda, who is basically the dominant rebel force right now, on one side and we have on the other side Hezbollah, Iran, Russia and Assad. JONES: I don't understand what you want to do, though. Here's my problem. You are a leader on Syria. You are a big supporter and, frankly, the author of the Syrian Accountability Act.



SANTORUM: I was.



JONES: And now you seem to have completely disappeared. What is it that you think that should happen? I want to show you -- show you these images that have shocked the world. Can we show these images?



Look at these children. They're twitching. They're dying. What if one of the mothers of one of those children called this station right now and said to you, ""Why won't you help me? Why won't you help my children?"" You're saying there's no interest in doing that.



SANTORUM: The reason the United States -- and I think Joe will agree with me on this. We may disagree on where we come out, but the reason the United States uses military forces for one reason and one reason only. It's in our national security interests.



JONES: We have no moral obligation?



SANTORUM: We have no moral obligation to use military force when it comes to a humanitarian situation. We have other obligations.



JONES: Look, what -- but what can we do?



SANTORUM: We need to get involved. We need to -- the Syrian Accountability Act was about political sanctions. It was about economic sanctions. It was no trip wire for military force. And when the president used the Syrian Accountability Act as reasons for Congress to support him, he misled the American public on that.



CUPP: Senator Santorum --



SANTORUM: As the author, I know that.



CUPP: Senator Santorum, I know you. We go back a little ways. We've had some conservations about faith and morality and values, social conservatism. I don't understand -- help me understand -- how you square your conscience with not going in and ending a conflict where hundreds of thousands have died? How -- how are you not concerned that this will become another Rwanda?



LIEBERMAN: They're fighting for their freedom, incidentally, which is what America's supposed to be all about.



CUPP: Yes. And how -- aren't you worried this will be another Rwanda?



LIEBERMAN: This didn't start out as al Qaeda.



SANTORUM: I agree. And I called for military force 18 months ago.



CUPP: Right. As did I. As did I.



LIEBERMAN: I met with the opposition. And there -- these were patriots, Syrian patriots, freedom fighters --



SANTORUM: Agreed.



LIEBERMAN: -- who were sick of the dictator.



SANTORUM: Agreed.



LIEBERMAN: We held back and al Qaeda came in. I don't think al Qaeda is the dominant force in the opposition. I think from all I know it's the Syrian people who want to change from Assad. And they deserve --



(CROSSTALK)



JONES: I want to give him a chance to say something, because listen, I want to double down on peace. I don't want to double down on war. I think that we have diplomatic options we haven't exhausted. My quarrel with the president all week long has been we're rushing to war.



But my problem is, I want to double down on peace; some people want to double down on war. It seems like you're doubling down on nothing. What do you want us to do?



SANTORUM: Let's -- let's --



JONES: If you were the president, what would you do?



SANTORUM: Well, first off, go back and look at the debates that occurred about 18 months ago. And I, in those debates, called for the president to intervene, to side with exactly the people that Joe Lieberman was talking about, and get involved, give them --



JONES: So we had an interest then, but we don't have an interest now?



Hold on a second. How do we have an interest then and not now?



CUPP: Everything has changed.



SANTORUM: Everything has changed. Everything has changed. The people who are the rebels in Syria right now are not the same people that we --



CUPP: That's right.



SANTORUM: That we could have been partners with 18 months ago.



LIEBERMAN: But it's not going to get better if we hang back. I mean, if we get involved in one level and support the moderates there -- and there are moderates there who are our friends -- then they'll have a better opportunity to control the country when Assad goes.



Right now, I think we've got to hang tough. And tonight, the president's got a real challenge, but -- because of all of the twists and turns of the story -- but he's got a great opportunity to tell people why he thinks it's worth us carrying out limited but decisive attacks. CUPP: What does he need to say tonight? What does he need to say tonight?



LIEBERMAN: Well, I think he needs to say, one, we can't -- we can't handle every problem in the world. But Americans, you know, we have a Declaration of Independence that talks about the self-evident truth that everybody -- not just Americans but in the world -- got from our creator the rights to life and liberty. And these people in Syria have been deprived of both of those rights.



CUPP: Right.



LIEBERMAN: But here's the point. If you let a dictator mass murder his people and you turn away from it, he's going to keep going. And every other madman is going to keep going.



CUPP: Sure. And haven't we learned this lesson?



SANTORUM: Two different -- two different lessons. First off, there are lot -- there are lots of dictators, unfortunately, in this world who are mass murdering their people. We've seen it. We've seen it under President Obama. We saw it under President Bush. It's under presidents for decades now. The United States has not stepped in unless there's a national security interest military. We've stepped in in other ways, but we have not stepped in militarily.



But the president is going to change that and say that humanitarian reasons and the reason we're going to step in and -- and engage in military conflict. We are broadening -- you want to talk about not being a cop on the beat. You want to talk about something you and folks that -- that have been advocating for us to have -- make peace not war. We've now opened up Pandora's box as to military use. It's a bad idea. It's not in the security interests.



JONES: I want -- I want you to respond to this. My quarrel with the president is I think he did two things right and one thing wrong. I think he was right to say this is an outrage, and we're not going to let babies get gassed.



CUPP: And then do nothing about it?



JONES: I think that was right. I think he was wrong to rush into a war posture without talking to Congress, without bringing in the U.N., without bringing a global coalition, without exhausting --



SANTORUM: He did that when he set the red line, with Russia. And he set the red line --



CUPP: Months ago.



JONES: And he did -- and I think he did. Because he waited -- and I'm surprised you say you wish we'd gone in -- because he waited, we now have a new opening.



Do you disagree that the president, by putting those warships out there and waiting, don't you agree he created an opening now for peace? You're saying that the president has done nothing right this whole crisis?



SANTORUM: If we believe Putin and Assad are legitimate actors in the diplomatic stage. Well, but that's who's come forward, and it's not --



CUPP: It's who we got.



SANTORUM: It's who we got. And so, look, I'm perfectly willing to let this play out. I want us to not strike Syria --



JONES: You and me both.



SANTORUM: -- because I think streaking Syria, at this point in time, will create a real problem for us militarily with Russia, with potentially others in the region.



We are taking -- and I think Joe will agree with me on this one. The whole Syria conflict at this point, has taken our eye off the ball. And the ball is Iran. Syria is a puppet state of Iran.



LIEBERMAN: That's exactly the reason why we can't let Assad get away.



CUPP: That's right. Iran is watching.



LIEBERMAN: It's the biggest body blow we could land to Iran. He's their only ally in the Arab world. And this -- even this proposal, which if it works for Russia, will be a good thing. The price of it will be that Assad will stay there, and Iran will still have its No. 1 ally in the Arab world.



CUPP: All right. Well, let's -- let's continue this over in the next -- in the next segment. There are a lot of creative solutions that don't involve bombing and killing people apparently.



Yes, there are and we'll talk about it when we get back. Thank you very much.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



JONES: Welcome back.



Tonight President Obama addresses the nation about Syria. He's hitting the pause button on the military strikes. That gives us time for some creative solutions. And we should keep the warships parked off of there. But what about helping refugees? What about an arms embargo? What about cyber-attacks, what about anything? It's all either war or nothing.



I'm going to ask you: If there were a dome over Syria, so it was not about bomb or don't bomb, what are some of the creative things we could do that don't involve war? How do we win without war?



LIEBERMAN: Unfortunately, if there were a dome over Syria, there was nothing we could do to stop the bloodshed. Because you've got a basically unfair fight here. The government has most of the fire power. Finally, the patriots, the freedom fighter Syrians, have gotten help from outside. But they're still getting decimated. So --



JONES: This is America. You're saying there's nothing we can do? It's either Tomahawk missiles or nothing? We're the most creative --



CUPP: But the dome doesn't exist, Van. The dome is fantasy land. Let's deal with reality.



JONES: The fact -- let's get with reality. We have someone here --



LIEBERMAN: Let me say something about the dome. Because the other reason it's gone --



CUPP: Van Jones Dome.



LIEBERMAN: The dome is unreal, but what that really reminds us of is that their neighbors there -- Israel, Iraq, Jordan -- they're all being -- Lebanon -- they're all being badly affected by what's going on in Syria. Our allies are.



JONES: This is a crisis in our country, of imagination. How can we get out of this without bombs. You tell us.



SANTORUM: That's why -- that's why Rick Santorum, 18 months ago, during the presidential campaign --



JONES: Today.



SANTORUM: -- said we should be arming the rebels.



CUPP: That's right.



SANTORUM: We should be supporting them militarily. We should be supporting them economically. We should be doing everything --



JONES: That's all in the past.



SANTORUM: We agree --



JONES: And now we give up. Because we didn't do what you wanted so we just give up.



SANTORUM: Because a lot of folks -- hello?



JONES: Hello?



SANTORUM: A lot of folks said no, we had no interest in this.



JONES: Hey, listen.



SANTORUM: Do you admit you were wrong?



JONES: I'll tell you what: I'm going to shock you. I think the Democrats were wrong for not taking Syria more seriously earlier. But I think it's wrong, and I'm giving you an opportunity. I don't want to go to war. I think there are a lot of things we could do that would get us out of the situation without war. You are somebody who's got some ideas about it, but I don't hear anybody talking about what can we do.



CUPP: Senator, you've said Assad -- Assad has to go. You've said Assad has to go. How do you do it without military intervention?



JONES: What can we do?



(CROSSTALK)



SANTORUM: This is very difficult right now. When you look at the rebels and the composition of the rebel forces, you see -- you're seeing on YouTube how rebel forces are, you know -- these radical al- Qaeda folks are killing off other rebel leaders and are doing atrocities to the public also.



JONES: But if you were president --



SANTORUM: You are going to say we are going to come on the side of them and help them.



JONES: That's terrible. Help us.



SANTORUM: But we can't. No, what we have to do is do what we should have done from the very beginning, which is let's identify, as we can, and support and protect and defend the legitimate elements within the rebel forces. Begin the process of arming them, protecting them, et cetera.



JONES: You agree with this?



LIEBERMAN: I totally agree. I just want to say something. You've been using the word ""war."" Nobody's talking about war. President Obama's not talking about war. He's not talking about any American boots on the ground. He's talking about limited, decisive attacks.



CUPP: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Because you are not that naive, Senator Lieberman. You know that, even though President Obama is saying no boots on the ground, if one of our planes goes down, we're sending boots on the ground.



LIEBERMAN: Yes, but that -- everybody's --



CUPP: This is a lot bigger conflict than he thinks.



LIEBERMAN: I don't believe so. It's not going to be a massive land invasion.



Incidentally, what the president could have done when he decided to send it to Congress in taking the military action limited that he has in mind, is not a precedent. President Reagan did it in Grenada and struck at Libya when he thought the Libyans blew up a disco in Germany.



You know, President Clinton went into Bosnia, and people could argue we had no national security interests there, but a lot of people were getting slaughtered --



CUPP: Right.



LIEBERMAN: -- by the Serbs at that point. And it goes on and on. So --



JONES: I'm glad the president went to Congress. I think the president going to Congress is the best thing that happened, because it gave us time. You don't agree with me.



LIEBERMAN: No. Here's my concern when he did it. I don't think he had to do it. He himself said, and I think he was right, that he had the legal authority to take action himself as commander in chief under the War Powers Resolution, everything else. He took an enormous risk, and unfortunately, he's in a quagmire now, because the risk was that Congress would say no.



JONES: Well, now they're both being delayed, and the U.N. is -- the U.N. is now a forum where -- I don't understand why you can say it's a bad thing. The delay gave us time.



CUPP: Don't worry. The U.N.'s on it.



SANTORUM: You may have not seen the polls. I'm not a great poll- watcher. But the American public is overwhelmingly against the president. The president's been making this case now for several weeks. They are against military action. They do not see any positive benefit for the United States in getting involved in a war between two radical elements of which neither are our friends.



LIEBERMAN: Now I want to -- I want to quote you -- I'm quoting from the New Testament, Corinthians: ""When the sound of the trumpet is uncertain, who will follow into battle?"" So I think people are so confused about what's going on here. If --



SANTORUM: The president says he has to do it, but then he goes to Congress.



LIEBERMAN: If you looked at the polls earlier, there was authority for a limited strike without American boots on the ground, particularly if we had some support from other --



CUPP: Let me ask you, Senator -- go ahead.



SANTORUM: Here's the president says we need to do it, but I'm going to ask Congress. We need to strike, but it's not going to be decisive. Of course, the American people is going to say what the heck are we doing here?



Because here's the problem: If we actually do act, and if the Russians or the Iranians or somebody else say, ""You know what? You've drawn a line in the sand for us and we're going to -- we're going to act back,"" now we've put the United States in a much broader war with a president who is clearly over his head.



JONES: Listen, I don't -- I do not agree the president is in over his head. First of all, let's be clear. This is a president who built a -- he built a coalition to --



SANTORUM: Really?



JONES: Let me finish. He isolated Iran.



SANTORUM: A coalition?



JONES: Let's walk through the list before we take him down too hard. He got -- he got Russia and China to be with us against Iran.



SANTORUM: Stop right there. Stop. Whoa!



LIEBERMAN: Forget Libya.



JONES: Libya.



SANTORUM: Stop at Iran. Is Iran pursuing the nuclear weapons program? They have not drawn down.



JONES: The answer is -- Do you want a war? Do you want a war?



SANTORUM: We have drawn a red line.



JONES: Yes. We're doing cyber-attacks. We're doing an embargo.



SANTORUM: We have drawn a red line with Iran, and we have done nothing publicly.



CUPP: Let me ask you. This is a very good opportunity --



(CROSSTALK)



CUPP: This is a very good opportunity -- very good opportunity to talk about the U.N. The U.N. -- no one, maybe except Van, trusts the Russians in this new plan to seize chemical weapons from Assad. But I fear that a lot of people trust the U.N. to do that.



The U.N. does not have a terribly impressive track record when it comes to ending conflicts. Are you worried? Should the American people trust U.N. to oversee this new Russian plan?



LIEBERMAN: The U.N. works sometimes. Other times it doesn't. The record is mixed. The question is what passes in the U.N.? If, as France --



CUPP: Well, nothing if you're Russia and China.



LIEBERMAN: France tabled a resolution in the Security Council today that basically embraced the Russian proposal that the Syrians get rid of their chemical weapons with international supervision and said that, if they didn't, then force was authorized by the U.N. Security Council. I thought that was great, because it called -- called Russia's bluff.



And what do you think Russia did? They said that was unacceptable. They don't want a mandatory resolution with teeth in it. They want it to be a presidential statement of kind of appealing to Syria.



CUPP: Senator Santorum, do you trust the U.N.?



SANTORUM: It calls into question Russia's credibility with this entire proposal.



CUPP: Do you trust -- wait, let me ask. Do you trust the U.N.?



JONES: Hold on.



SANTORUM: Pick an issue. The answer is no.



CUPP: Exactly right.



JONES: A hundred and seventy-two successful peacekeeping missions and negotiations for some. Listen, we always focus -- 172 --



CUPP: Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Rwanda, Bosnia --



JONES: The world is a tough, nasty place, and we focus on the places the U.N. has not been able to change human nature. But we are in a much safer world because of the U.N. than we would be without it.



CUPP: That is not -- that is a total inaccuracy.



JONES: Look right here: 172 peacekeeping --



CUPP: I have a list, too, of atrocities that they have taken responsibility for and not changed. The world feels very good about itself when it allows the U.N. to take over, because it feels like it's doing something. It's false security.



JONES: Well, listen -- Here's what I don't understand. When George W. Bush brought in the United Nations, people thought that was a good thing. He was trying to bring in the global community. I thought that you wanted us to build a big global coalition. I think we have a moment now to do so.



And why do we have it? We have it for two reasons. One, he went to Congress, which you don't like. And two, because as much as we do not trust the Russians for their own interests, they are moving. Why are you mad at Congress and the U.N.?



(CROSSTALK)



SANTORUM: Name -- name the countries that are for the United States getting involved militarily in Syria.



JONES: Well, apparently, there's France. Militarily?



LIEBERMAN: The people that want us to --



(CROSSTALK)



JONES: You can answer that.



LIEBERMAN: There's about 15 that signed that statement calling for action.



SANTORUM: Action but not military action.



LIEBERMAN: But you know what? The president has --



SANTORUM: There's a big difference between action and military action. I'm for action. I'm just not for -- I'm not for a military strike. Particularly one that's not decisive and is not going to accomplish anything.



LIEBERMAN: But here's the problem. I think a military strike today will hurt Assad. I think that's the reason why, at least in words, he's accepted this Russian proposal.



I don't believe him for a minute. I'll believe it when I see it, when he gives us his chemical weapons.



SANTORUM: Let's play it out.



LIEBERMAN: But I think he's scared of a strike. We're going to hit his command and control.



SANTORUM: Let's play it out. We strike Assad. We -- we knock out a few command and control operations. Then where do we go?



LIEBERMAN: Then we give more support to the Syrian opposition. Because they will have a tremendous boost in morale.



SANTORUM: Why can't we do that without striking?



LIEBERMAN: We can, but we've got to strike him because he used chemical weapons. And if we don't, then he'll use them again.



SANTORUM: And you don't have any -- you don't have any fear or concern that any other country will, as a result of us striking Syria, do something to -- to insert themselves even in that conflict or potentially against the United States?



LIEBERMAN: They might but you know, when you're -- we can't -- we can't act out of fear of what might happen. We're strong. We're still the strongest country in the world.



SANTORUM: We're not. We're not acting like -- we're not acting like a leader. We're not acting strong. We're acting like someone who said, don't knock this off my shoulder and you do. And so I -- OK, so I've got a fight back. We have to have --



(CROSSTALK)



LIEBERMAN: The shoulder was the high moral ground about --



SANTORUM: It wasn't a high moral ground.



LIEBERMAN: Hitler, Saddam Hussein, Assad have used chemical weapons.



SANTORUM: Chemical weapons -- LIEBERMAN: You've got to say no.



SANTORUM: Chemical weapons is very different than WMD that Iran is working on. That's where we should focus our attention.



CUPP: OK. Thanks to Joe Lieberman and Rick Santorum. It was a great debate. We appreciate it.



Next, we ""Cease Fire."" There's something important here we need to agree on. Not just the two of us but the whole country.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



JONES: Tonight on CROSSFIRE, we've been debating and fighting about what to do about Syria. But now we're going to call a ""Cease Fire.""



Now I think, and I want to come back to a point I made. I think that I have to admit that you guys have been right about something. You guys have been out, you in particular, out there for two years saying we've got to do something about Syria, something about Syria.



I hate your solution.



CUPP: Yes.



JONES: I don't like the war. But you are pointing to the right problem. And I think a lot of people on the left were ducking it, and we weren't dealing with it. And I think that what my lesson out of this is, even when we don't agree, we've got to listen to each other more than we did.



CUPP: Well, and I appreciate that. And I will return a favor and say, look, I don't agree with your solutions either, but at least you've been consistent. I think a lot of Democrats and liberals have talked about President Obama's foreign policy as somehow morally superior to President Bush's. And you hold Obama to the same standard as you hold President Bush, and that -- that says a lot about your credibility.



JONES: Here we go. The two of us, we agreed, and the world didn't come to an end.



CUPP: Here's another thing we agree on: Your opinion matters. You can weigh in on our ""Fire Back"" question via Facebook or Twitter. ""Should the U.S. trust Russia's offer to rid Syria of chemical weapons?"" Right now 41 percent of you say yes; 59 percent say no.



JONES: The debate continues online at CNN.com/crossfire. You can also go to Facebook and Twitter.



From the left, I'm Van Jones.



CUPP: and from the right, I'm S.C. Cupp. Join us tomorrow for another edition of CROSSFIRE.



A special edition of ""ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT"" starts right now.

politifact3734,"Remarks by the President on Comprehensive Immigration Reform in El Paso, Texas1:21 P.M. MDT



THE PRESIDENT: Hello, El Paso! (Applause.) Well, it is wonderful -- wonderful to be back with all of you in the Lone Star State. (Applause.) Everything is bigger in Texas. (Applause.)



AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!



THE PRESIDENT: I love you back! (Applause.) Even the welcomes are bigger. (Applause.) So, in appreciation, I wanted to give a big policy speech outside on a really hot day. (Laughter.) Those of you who are still wearing your jackets, feel free to take them off. I hope everybody is wearing sunscreen.



AUDIENCE MEMBER: We live here.



THE PRESIDENT: You say you live here? You don’t need it, huh? (Laughter.) Well, it is a great honor to be here. And I want to express my appreciation to all of you for taking the time to come out today.



AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!



THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you. (Applause.)



You know, about a week ago, I delivered a commencement address at Miami Dade Community College, which is one of the most diverse schools in the nation. The graduates were proud that their class could claim heritage from 181 countries around the world -- 181 countries. (Applause.)



Many of the students were immigrants themselves, coming to America with little more than the dream of their parents and the clothes on their back. A handful had discovered only in adolescence or adulthood that they were undocumented. But they worked hard and they gave it their all, and so they earned those diplomas.



And at the ceremony, 181 flags -- one for every nation that was represented -- was marched across the stage. And each one was applauded by the graduates and the relatives with ties to those countries. So when the Haitian flag went by, all the Haitian kids -- Haitian American kids shouted out. And when the Guatemalan flag went by, all the kids of Guatemalan heritage shouted out. And when the Ukrainian flag went by, I think one kid shouted out. (Laughter.) This was down in Miami. (Laughter.) If it had been in Chicago, there would have been more.



But then, the last flag, the American flag, came into view. And everyone in the room erupted in applause. Everybody cheered. (Applause.) So, yes, their parents and grandparents -- some of the graduates themselves -- had come from every corner of the globe. But it was here that they had found opportunity. It was here that they had a chance to contribute to the nation that is their home.



And it was a reminder of a simple idea, as old as America itself: E pluribus unum. Out of many, one. We define ourselves as a nation of immigrants -- a nation that welcomes those willing to embrace America’s ideals and America’s precepts. That’s why millions of people, ancestors to most of us, braved hardship and great risk to come here -- so they could be free to work and worship and start a business and live their lives in peace and prosperity. The Asian immigrants who made their way to California’s Angel Island. The German and Scandinavians who settled across the Midwest. The waves of Irish, and Italian, and Polish, and Russian, and Jewish immigrants who leaned against the railing to catch their first glimpse of the Statue of Liberty.



This flow of immigrants has helped make this country stronger and more prosperous. (Applause.) We can point to the genius of Einstein, the designs of I. M. Pei, the stories of Isaac Asimov, the entire industries that were forged by Andrew Carnegie.



And then when I think about immigration I think about the naturalization ceremonies that we’ve held at the White House for members of our military. Nothing could be more inspiring. Even though they were not yet citizens when they joined our military, these men and women signed up to serve.



We did one event at the White House and a young man named Granger Michael from Papua New Guinea, a Marine who had been deployed to Iraq three times, was there. And you know what he said about becoming an American citizen? He said, “I might as well. I love this country already.” That’s all he said. Marines aren’t big on speeches. (Laughter.)



Another was a woman named Perla Ramos who was born and raised in Mexico and came to the United States shortly after 9/11, and joined the Navy. And she said, “I take pride in our flag and the history we write day by day.”



That’s the promise of this country -- that anyone can write the next chapter in our story. It doesn’t matter where you come from -- (applause) -- it doesn’t matter where you come from; it doesn’t matter what you look like; it doesn’t matter what faith you worship. What matters is that you believe in the ideals on which we were founded; that you believe that all of us are created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. (Applause.) All of us deserve our freedoms and our pursuit of happiness. In embracing America, you can become American. That is what makes this country great. That enriches all of us.



And yet, at the same time, we’re here at the border today -- (applause) -- we’re here at the border because we also recognize that being a nation of laws goes hand in hand with being a nation of immigrants. This, too, is our heritage. This, too, is important. And the truth is, we’ve often wrestled with the politics of who is and who isn’t allowed to come into this country. This debate is not new.



At times, there has been fear and resentment directed towards newcomers, especially in hard economic times. And because these issues touch deeply on what we believe, touch deeply on our convictions -- about who we are as a people, about what it means to be an American -- these debates often elicit strong emotions.



That’s one reason it’s been so difficult to reform our broken immigration system. When an issue is this complex, when it raises such strong feelings, it’s easier for politicians to defer until the problem the next election. And there’s always a next election.



So we’ve seen a lot of blame and a lot of politics and a lot of ugly rhetoric around immigration. And we’ve seen good faith efforts from leaders of both parties -- by the way, I just noticed, those of you who have chairs, if you want to sit down, feel free. There’s no rule about having to stand when I’m --



AUDIENCE MEMBER: -- we love you! (Applause.)



THE PRESIDENT: But we’ve seen leaders of both parties who try to work on this issue, but then their efforts fell prey to the usual Washington games. And all the while, we’ve seen the mounting consequences of decades of inaction.



Today, there are an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants here in the United States. Some crossed the border illegally. Others avoid immigration laws by overstaying their visas. Regardless of how they came, the overwhelming majority of these folks are just trying to earn a living and provide for their families. (Applause.)



But we have to acknowledge they’ve broken the rules. They’ve cut in front of the line. And what is also true is that the presence of so many illegal immigrants makes a mockery of all those who are trying to immigrate legally.



Also, because undocumented immigrants live in the shadows, where they’re vulnerable to unscrupulous businesses that skirt taxes, and pay workers less than the minimum wage, or cut corners with health and safety laws, this puts companies who follow the rules, and Americans who rightly demand the minimum wage or overtime or just a safe place to work, it puts those businesses at a disadvantage.



Think about it. Over the past decade, even before the recession hit, middle-class families were struggling to get by as the costs went up for everything, from health care, to college tuition, to groceries, to gas. Their incomes didn’t go up with those prices. We’re seeing it again right now with gas prices.



So one way to strengthen the middle class in America is to reform the immigration system so that there is no longer a massive underground economy that exploits a cheap source of labor while depressing wages for everybody else. I want incomes for middle-class families to rise again. (Applause.) I want prosperity in this country to be widely shared. (Applause.) I want everybody to be able to reach that American dream. And that’s why immigration reform is an economic imperative. It’s an economic imperative. (Applause.)



And reform will also help to make America more competitive in the global economy. Today, we provide students from around the world with visas to get engineering and computer science degrees at our top universities. (Applause.)



But then our laws discourage them from using those skills to start a business or a new industry here in the United States. Instead of training entrepreneurs to stay here, we train them to create jobs for our competition. That makes no sense. In a global marketplace, we need all the talent we can attract, all the talent we can get to stay here to start businesses -- not just to benefit those individuals, but because their contribution will benefit all Americans.



Look at Intel, look at Google, look at Yahoo, look at eBay. All those great American companies, all the jobs they’ve created, everything that has helped us take leadership in the high-tech industry, every one of those was founded by, guess who, an immigrant. (Applause.)



So we don’t want the next Intel or the next Google to be created in China or India. We want those companies and jobs to take root here. (Applause.) Bill Gates gets this. He knows a little something about the high-tech industry. He said, “The United States will find it far more difficult to maintain its competitive edge if it excludes those who are able and willing to help us compete.”



So immigration is not just the right thing to do. It’s smart for our economy. It’s smart for our economy. (Applause.) And it’s for this reason that businesses all across America are demanding that Washington finally meet its responsibilities to solve the immigration problem. Everybody recognizes the system is broken. The question is, will we finally summon the political will to do something about it? And that’s why we’re here at the border today.



And I want to say I am joined today by an outstanding Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, who’s been working tirelessly on this issue. (Applause.) Our commissioner who’s working diligently on border issues, Alan Bersin, is there, and we appreciate him -- Bersin. (Applause.)



So they’re doing outstanding work. And in recent years, among one of the greatest impediments to reform were questions about border security. And these were legitimate concerns. What was true was a lack of manpower and a lack of resources at the border, combined with the pull of jobs and ill-considered enforcement once folks were in the country.



All this contributed to a growing number of undocumented people living in the United States. And these concerns helped unravel a bipartisan coalition that we had forged back when I was in the United States Senate. So in the years since, “borders first, borders first,” that's become the common refrain, even among those who were previously supportive of comprehensive immigration reform.



But over the last two years, thanks to the outstanding work of Janet and Alan and everybody who’s down here working at the border, we’ve answered those concerns. Under their leadership, we have strengthened border security beyond what many believed was possible. They wanted more agents at the border. Well, we now have more boots on the ground on the southwest border than at any time in our history. (Applause.)



The Border Patrol has 20,000 agents -- more than twice as many as there were in 2004. It’s a build-up that began under President Bush and that we’ve continued, and I had a chance to meet some of these outstanding agents, and actually saw some of them on horseback who looked pretty tough. (Laughter.) So we put the agents here.



Then they wanted a fence. Well, the fence is --



AUDIENCE: Booo!



THE PRESIDENT: The fence is now basically complete.



AUDIENCE MEMBER: Tear it down!



THE PRESIDENT: Then we’ve gone further. We tripled the number of intelligence analysts working at the border. I’ve deployed unmanned aerial vehicles to patrol the skies from Texas to California. We have forged a partnership with Mexico to fight the transnational criminal organizations that have affected both of our countries. (Applause.) And for the first time -- for the first time we’re screening 100 percent of southbound rail shipments to seize guns and money going south even as we go after drugs that are coming north. (Applause.)



So, here’s the point. I want everybody to listen carefully to this. We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement. All the stuff they asked for, we’ve done. But even though we’ve answered these concerns, I’ve got to say I suspect there are still going to be some who are trying to move the goal posts on us one more time.



AUDIENCE MEMBER: They’re racist!



THE PRESIDENT: You know, they said we needed to triple the Border Patrol. Or now they’re going to say we need to quadruple the Border Patrol. Or they’ll want a higher fence. Maybe they’ll need a moat. (Laughter.) Maybe they want alligators in the moat. (Laughter.) They’ll never be satisfied. And I understand that. That’s politics.



But the truth is the measures we’ve put in place are getting results. Over the past two and a half years, we’ve seized 31 percent more drugs, 75 percent more currency, 64 percent more weapons than ever before. (Applause.) And even as we have stepped up patrols, apprehensions along the border have been cut by nearly 40 percent from two years ago. That means far fewer people are attempting to cross the border illegally.



And also, despite a lot of breathless reports that have tagged places like El Paso as dangerous, violent crime in southwest border counties has dropped by a third. El Paso and other cities and towns along this border are consistently among the safest in the nation. (Applause.) Of course, we shouldn’t accept any violence or crime. And we’ve always got more work to do. But this progress is important and it’s not getting reported on.



And we’re also going beyond the border. Beyond the border, we’re going after employers who knowingly exploit people and break the law. (Applause.) And we are deporting those who are here illegally. And that’s a tough issue. It’s a source of controversy.



But I want to emphasize we’re not doing it haphazardly. We’re focusing our limited resources and people on violent offenders and people convicted of crimes -- not just families, not just folks who are just looking to scrape together an income. And as a result, we’ve increased the removal of criminals by 70 percent. (Applause.)



That’s not to ignore the real human toll of a broken immigration system. Even as we recognize that enforcing the law is necessary, we don’t relish the pain that it causes in the lives of people who are just trying to get by and get caught up in the system.



And as long as the current laws are on the books, it’s not just hardened felons who are subject to removal, but sometimes families who are just trying to earn a living, or bright, eager students, or decent people with the best of intentions. (Applause.)



And sometimes when I talk to immigration advocates, they wish I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself. But that’s not how a democracy works. What we really need to do is to keep up the fight to pass genuine, comprehensive reform. That is the ultimate solution to this problem. That's what I’m committed to doing. (Applause.)



AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, we can! Yes, we can!



THE PRESIDENT: Yes, we can. We can do it. (Applause.)



AUDIENCE: Yes, we can! Yes, we can! Yes, we can!



THE PRESIDENT: The most significant step we can now take to secure the borders is to fix the system as a whole so that fewer people have the incentive to enter illegally in search of work in the first place. This would allow agents to focus on the worst threats on both of our -- both sides of our borders, from drug traffickers to those who would come here to commit acts of violence or terror. That’s where our focus should be.



So, El Paso, the question is whether those in Congress who previously walked away in the name of enforcement are now ready to come back to the table and finish the work that we’ve started. (Applause.) We’ve got to put the politics aside. And if we do, I’m confident we can find common ground.



Washington is lagging behind the country on this. There is already a growing coalition of leaders across America who don’t always see eye-to-eye, but are coming together on this issue. They see the harmful consequences of a broken immigration system for their businesses and for their communities, and they understand why we need to act.



There are Democrats and Republicans, people like former Republican Senator Mel Martinez; former Bush administration Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff; leaders like Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York; evangelical ministers like Leith Anderson and Bill Hybels; police chiefs from across the nation; educators; advocates; labor unions; chambers of commerce; small business owners; Fortune 500 CEOs.



I mean, one CEO had this to say about reform: “American ingenuity is a product of the openness and diversity of this society. Immigrants have made America great as the world leader in business, in science, higher education and innovation.” You know who that leader was? Rupert Murdoch, who owns FOX News, and is an immigrant himself. I don’t know if you’re familiar with Rupert Murdoch’s views, but let’s just say he doesn’t have an Obama sticker on his car. (Laughter.) But he agrees with me on this. (Applause.)



So there is a consensus around fixing what’s broken. And now we need Congress to catch up. Now we need to come together around reform that reflects our values as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants; reform that demands that everybody take responsibility. So what would comprehensive reform look like?



First, we know that government has a threshold responsibility to secure our borders and enforce the law. And that’s what Janet and all her folks are doing. That’s what they’re doing. (Applause.)



Second, businesses have to be held accountable if they exploit undocumented workers. (Applause.)



Third, those who are here illegally, they have a responsibility as well. So they broke the law, and that means they’ve got to pay their taxes, they’ve got to pay a fine, they’ve got to learn English. And they’ve got to undergo background checks and a lengthy process before they get in line for legalization. That’s not too much to ask. (Applause.)



And fourth, stopping illegal immigration also depends on reforming our outdated system of legal immigration. (Applause.) We should make it easier for the best and the brightest to not only stay here, but also to start businesses and create jobs here. In recent years, a full 25 percent of high-tech startups in the U.S. were founded by immigrants. That led to 200,000 jobs here in America. I’m glad those jobs are here. I want to see more of them created in this country. We need to provide them the chance. (Applause.)



We need to provide our farms a legal way to hire workers that they rely on, and a path for those workers to earn legal status. (Applause.) And our laws should respect families following the rules -- reuniting them more quickly instead of splitting them apart. (Applause.)



Today, the immigration system not only tolerates those who break the rules, but it punishes folks who follow the rules. While applications -- while applicants wait for approval, for example, they’re often forbidden from visiting the United States. Even husbands and wives may have to spend years apart. Parents can’t see their children. I don’t believe the United States of America should be in the business of separating families. That’s not right. That’s not who we are. We can do better than that. (Applause.)



And we should stop punishing innocent young people for the actions of their parents. (Applause.) We should stop denying them the chance to earn an education or serve in the military. And that’s why we need to pass the DREAM Act. (Applause.) Now, we passed the DREAM Act through the House last year when Democrats were in control. But even though it received a majority of votes in the Senate, it was blocked when several Republicans who had previously supported the DREAM Act voted no.



That was a tremendous disappointment to get so close and then see politics get in the way. And as I gave that commencement at Miami Dade, it broke my heart knowing that a number of those promising, bright students -- young people who worked so hard and who speak about what’s best in America -- are at risk of facing the agony of deportation. These are kids who grew up in this country. They love this country. They know no other place to call home. The idea that we’d punish them is cruel. It makes no sense. We’re a better nation than that. (Applause.)



So we’re going to keep fighting for the DREAM Act. We’re going to keep up the fight for reform. (Applause.) And that’s where you come in. I’m going to do my part to lead a constructive and civil debate on these issues. And we’ve already had a series of meetings about this at the White House in recent weeks. We’ve got leaders here and around the country helping to move the debate forward.



But this change ultimately has to be driven by you, the American people. You’ve got to help push for comprehensive reform, and you’ve got to identify what steps we can take right now -- like the DREAM Act, like visa reform -- areas where we can find common ground among Democrats and Republicans and begin to fix what’s broken.



So I’m asking you to add your voices to this debate. You can sign up to help at whitehouse.gov. We need Washington to know that there is a movement for reform that’s gathering strength from coast to coast. That’s how we’ll get this done. That’s how we can ensure that in the years ahead we are welcoming the talents of all who can contribute to this country and that we’re living up to the basic American idea that you can make it here if you try. (Applause.)



That’s the idea that gave hope to José Hernández. Is José here? Where’s -- José is right over there. (Applause.) I want you to hear -- I want you to think about this story. José’s parents were migrant farm workers. And so, growing up, he was too. He was born in California, though he could have just as easily been born on the other side of the border, if it had been a different time of year, because his family moved around with the seasons. So two of his siblings were actually born in Mexico.



So they traveled a lot, and José joined his parents picking cucumbers and strawberries. And he missed part of school when they returned to Mexico each winter. José didn’t learn English until he was 12 years old. But you know what, José was good at math and he liked math. And the nice thing is that math was the same in every school, and it’s the same in Spanish as it is in English.



So José studied, and he studied hard. And one day, he’s standing in the fields, collecting sugar beets, and he heard on a transistor radio that a man named Franklin Chang-Diaz -- a man with a surname like his -- was going to be an astronaut for NASA. So José decided -- right there in the field, he decided -- well, I could be an astronaut, too.



So José kept on studying, and he graduated high school. And he kept on studying, and he earned an engineering degree. And he kept on studying, and he earned a graduate degree. And he kept on working hard, and he ended up at a national laboratory, helping to develop a new kind of digital medical imaging system.



And a few years later, he found himself more than 100 miles above the surface of the Earth, staring out of the window of the shuttle Discovery, and he was remembering the boy in the California fields with that crazy dream that in America everything is possible. (Applause.)



Think about that, El Paso. That’s the American Dream right there. (Applause.) That's what we’re fighting for. We are fighting for every boy and every girl like José with a dream and potential that's just waiting to be tapped. We are fighting to unlock that promise, and all that holds not just for their futures, but for America’s future. That's why we’re going to get this done. And that's why I’m going to need your help.



Thank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

politifact1770,"Terror Suspects Are Buying Guns - and the FBI Can't Stop ThemIt's amazing but true: we can prevent terror suspects from boarding an airplane, but the FBI doesn't have the power to block them from buying dynamite or an AK-47.

I believe strongly that they should. And so do the 500 mayors who are members of our bi-partisan coalition of Mayor Against Illegal Guns.

It is time to close the ""Terror Gap"" in our gun laws.

This morning I will be testifying at a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security Committee about the easy access that terror suspects have to guns and explosives. I wanted to share with lawmakers the hard-earned perspective New Yorkers have on this national security risk.

The car bomb the New York City Police Department found in Times Square on Saturday night was not the only attempted terrorist attack on our city since 9/11 -- far from it. And sadly, it won't be the last.

Since 1990, there have been more than 20 terrorists plots -- or actual attacks -- against our city.

In the last year alone, the NYPD -- working closely with federal authorities -- prevented two major planned attacks on our City. The first was last May, when the terrorists purchased guns and explosives as part of a planned attack on a Temple and Jewish Center in the Bronx.

The second was in September, when the City and federal authorities broke up a plot to detonate explosives in the New York City subway system.

And, of course, attacks and planned attacks have not been limited to New York.

Last June in Little Rock, Arkansas, a man opened fire at a military recruiting station, killing one private and wounding another. At the time of the shooting, the FBI was already investigating the man after his arrest in Yemen with a fake Somali passport. He was charged with murder and 16 counts of terrorist acts.

And on November 5, 2009, Major Nidal Hasan shot 43 people at Fort Hood -- killing 13. We know Hasan was able to buy a handgun despite having been under investigation by the FBI for links to terrorism.

The Bush Administration first proposed closing the Terror Gap in 2007. But because Congress has failed to act on that proposal, people who may want to do our country harm have been able to buy guns and explosives.

Today, the Government Accountability Office has released new data showing that suspects on the terrorism watch lists were able to buy guns and explosives from licensed US dealers 1,119 times between 2004 and 2010.

That is a serious and dangerous breach of national security.

That's why the more than 500 mayors in Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition that I co-chair with Mayor Tom Menino of Boston, support legislation to close the Terror Gap. This issue is a centerpiece of the coalition's fight to strengthen the federal background check system. Today, we have launched a new website -- www.TerrorGap.org -- to help educate Congress and the public about the Terror Gap and its consequences.

This legislation would give FBI agents the authority to block terror suspects from buying guns and explosives. It would also give them the ability to make exceptions when they determine that blocking a sale might tip off a suspect who is under investigation.

And the bill also allows those on the list to appeal their status to the Justice Department -- and challenge the determination in court.

Attorney General Eric Holder supported closing the Terror Gap in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year. And so does the vast majority of Americans.

A December poll by Republican pollster Frank Luntz found that 82% of NRA members, and 86% of other gun owners, support closing the Terror Gap.

To learn more and take action, please visit: www.TerrorGap.org.

In New York City, we are doing everything humanly possible to prevent another terrorist attack. Under Commissioner Kelly's leadership, the NYPD has developed one of the world's most advanced counter-terrorism programs. One thousand of our best officers work on counter-terrorism and intelligence efforts every day.

A key element of any smart counter-terrorism strategy is to make it harder for terrorists to strike.

That's why air passengers walk through metal detectors.

That's why our police officers randomly check bags in the subway.

That's why our police officers patrol sensitive locations.

And that's why it's just common sense to give the FBI the authority to keep terror suspects from buying guns and explosives.

Now, finally, it's time for Congress to act and fix the Terror Gap. Visit: www.TerrorGap.org.

politifact8805,"Laws Affecting Reproductive Health and Rights: 2013 State Policy Reviewby Elizabeth Nash, Rachel Benson Gold, Andrea Rowan, Gwendolyn Rathbun and Yana Vierboom

Reproductive health and rights were once again the subject of extensive debate in state capitols in 2013. Over the course of the year, 39 states enacted 141 provisions related to reproductive health and rights. Half of these new provisions, 70 in 22 states, sought to restrict access to abortion services. In sharp contrast to this barrage of abortion restrictions, a handful of states adopted measures designed to expand access to reproductive health services. Most notably, California enacted the first new state law in more than seven years designed to expand access to abortion, and five states adopted measures to expand access to comprehensive sex education, facilitate access to emergency contraception for women who have been sexually assaulted and enable patients’ partners to obtain STI treatment.

Abortion

Twenty-two states enacted 70 abortion restrictions during 2013. This makes 2013 second only to 2011 in the number of new abortion restrictions enacted in a single year. To put recent trends in even sharper relief, 205 abortion restrictions were enacted over the past three years (2011–2013), but just 189 were enacted during the entire previous decade (2001–2010).

[[nid:18887 field_align=_none]]

Forty-five percent of the abortion restrictions enacted over the last three years fall into four categories: targeted restrictions on abortion providers (TRAP), limitations on insurance coverage of abortion, bans on abortions at 20 weeks postfertilization (the equivalent of 22 weeks after a woman’s last menstrual period) and limitations on medication abortion. States enacted 93 measures in these four categories from 2011 through 2013, compared with 22 during the previous decade.

The number of new abortion restrictions ballooned from 43 enacted in 2012 to 70 in 2013. Four states were key to this increase. North Dakota and Texas, which did not have legislative sessions in 2012, together enacted 13 restrictions in 2013. In addition, the 2012 elections brought changes to the legislature in Arkansas and the governor’s mansion in North Carolina that created environments more hostile to abortion; after adopting no abortion restrictions in 2012, these two states together enacted 13 new restrictions in 2013.

This legislative onslaught has dramatically changed the landscape for women needing abortion. In 2000, the two states that were the most restrictive in the nation, Mississippi and Utah, had five of 10 major types of abortion restrictions in effect (see Appendix). By 2013, however, 22 states had five or more restrictions, and Louisiana had 10.

In 2000, 13 states had at least four types of major abortion restrictions and so were considered hostile to abortion rights (see Troubling Trend: More States Hostile to Abortion Rights as Middle Ground Shrinks); 27 states fell into this category by 2013. In contrast, the number of states supportive of abortion rights fell from 17 to 13, while the number of middle-ground states was cut in half, from 20 to 10. The proportion of women living in restrictive states went from 31% to 56%, while the proportion living in supportive states fell from 40% to 31% over the same period.

[[nid:18888 field_align=_none]]

Against this backdrop, it is particularly noteworthy that California moved to significantly improve access to early abortion services by expanding the types of providers permitted to perform either medication or surgical abortions. Legislation enacted in September allows physician assistants, certified nurse midwives and nurse practitioners to provide abortions during the first trimester. Thirty-nine states limit the provision of abortion services to licensed physicians (see Overview of Abortion Laws). Also this year, Colorado repealed its pre-Roe abortion law. Although these measures are not enforced, 12 states continue to have pre-Roe laws on the books (see Abortion Policy in the Absence of Roe).

Despite this progress, the overwhelming preponderance of legislation concerning abortion was aimed at restricting access to the procedure. Four types of restrictions dominated the legislative scene during 2013: abortion bans, restrictions on abortion providers, limitations on the provision of medication abortion and restrictions on coverage of abortion in private health plans. Together, legislation in these four categories accounted for 56% of all restrictions enacted over the year.

Bans on Abortion

Overtly flouting the standard established by Roe v. Wade, two states enacted laws banning abortion early in pregnancy. In March, the Arkansas legislature overrode a veto by Gov. Mike Beebe (D) to ban abortions occurring more than 12 weeks after a woman’s last menstrual period. Later that month, North Dakota enacted a ban on abortions occurring after a fetal heartbeat is detected, something that generally occurs at about six weeks after a woman’s last menstrual period. Legal challenges were quickly filed to both measures and enforcement is blocked while litigation proceeds. Additionally, the North Dakota legislature also approved an initiative that will be placed on the November 2014 ballot to ban abortion entirely by defining a person as a “human being at any stage of development.” Currently, no state has a law in effect prohibiting abortions early in pregnancy (see Abortion Policy in the Absence of Roe).

Antiabortion legislators in 11 states introduced measures aimed at banning abortion later in pregnancy based on the spurious belief that a fetus can feel pain at that point of development, and three new laws were enacted in Arkansas, North Dakota and Texas. These laws ban nearly all abortions performed at or beyond 20 weeks postfertilization (the equivalent of 22 weeks after the woman’s last menstrual period). All three have gone into effect, bringing to nine the number of states with a 20-week ban in effect (see State Policies on Later Abortions ). (A similar 20-week ban was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in June; although introduced in the Senate late in the year, the measure was not voted on.)

Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers (TRAP)

Eight states enacted onerous and irrelevant licensing requirements targeting abortion clinics and providers in 2013. These laws are designed to discourage medical professionals from providing abortion and make it impossible for clinics to remain open (see TRAP Laws Gain Political Traction While Abortion Clinics—and the Women They Serve—Pay the Price). Most often, these restrictions require abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital, mandate transfer agreements with hospitals or impose onerous structural requirements on clinics.

Four states (Alabama, North Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin) enacted laws that require providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. These measures effectively give hospitals veto power over clinics’ ability to provide services. All four were immediately challenged in court; enforcement of the Alabama, North Dakota and Wisconsin laws was temporarily blocked, but the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for implementation of the Texas requirement as the litigation proceeds. Nine states now have laws requiring abortion providers to have hospital privileges; four are in effect (see State Policies on Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers).

Ohio has long required abortion providers to have an agreement with a hospital allowing the transfer of patients needing emergency care. In June, the state adopted a new provision prohibiting public hospitals from entering into these transfer agreements. Including Ohio, nine states require abortion providers to have transfer agreements, measures that do little to add to existing patient safeguards in the event of an emergency.

Over the course of 2013, five states implemented new structural standards for abortion providers. North Carolina and Texas enacted measures requiring abortion clinics to meet essentially the same standards required for comprehensive ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) that provide more invasive and risky procedures and use higher levels of anesthesia. Alabama adopted somewhat more limited requirements relating to emergency care and fire safety. Virginia, meanwhile, finalized regulations to implement its 2011 TRAP law. Finally, Indiana, which had already required sites where surgical abortion was performed to adhere to standards similar to those for ASCs, extended these requirements to apply to sites where only medication abortion is performed. Including these new requirements, 26 states now require abortion facilities to essentially meet ASC standards.

Medication Abortion

Seventeen states have adopted restrictions on medication abortion over the last three years— making it one of the most frequent targets of abortion opponents (see Medication Abortion Restrictions Burden Women and Providers—and Threaten U.S. Trend Toward Very Early Abortion). In 2013 alone, eight states moved to ban the use of telemedicine in administering the medication, despite the fact that telemedicine is rapidly gaining acceptance as a way to expand access to health care. Over the course of the year, seven states (Alabama, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina and Texas) enacted laws effectively banning the use of telemedicine for medication abortion. In addition, the Iowa Board of Medicine adopted regulations prohibiting the use of telemedicine for medication abortion. Over the course of the year, courts blocked enforcement of the Iowa regulations, as well as earlier laws that had been enacted in North Dakota and Wisconsin. As of December, 14 states have measures in effect blocking the use of telemedicine to provide medication abortion (see State Policies on Medication Abortion).

The second way states have moved to restrict access to medication abortion is by requiring use of an outdated protocol that mandates a high dose of the medicine (in contrast to a widely used evidence-based protocol that permits a lower dose), prohibits its use after 49 days of pregnancy and requires the woman to make an extra trip to the clinic. In 2013, Texas adopted a variation on this approach by permitting use of the lower dose but retaining the two other limitations. The state joins Ohio in requiring use of the outdated protocol.

Finally, Oklahoma adopted a law in 2010 designed to ban medication abortion entirely. In 2012, the state’s supreme court overturned the law and in November, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take the case. As a result, the ban is not in effect.

Private Insurance Coverage of Abortion

States adopted three types of restrictions on insurance coverage of abortion. Michigan’s new measure is the most expansive of those enacted in 2013, it prohibits abortion coverage in private health plans except when the woman’s life is endangered. This brings to nine the number of states with restrictions that apply to all private health plans (see State Policies on Restricting Insurance Coverage of Abortion).

The Michigan provisions also specifically prohibit plans participating in the health exchange from providing coverage beyond situations when the woman’s life is endangered. Three other states (Arkansas, North Carolina and Pennsylvania) also enacted provisions that greatly restrict abortion coverage in the health exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act and only allow coverage in cases of life endangerment, rape and incest. Additional abortion coverage in Arkansas, Michigan and Pennsylvania is available only through the purchase of a separate rider at an additional cost. Including these four states, 24 states have banned abortion coverage in health exchanges.

North Carolina enacted a measure prohibiting health plans for county or municipal employees from covering abortion except in cases of life endangerment, rape or incest. The Georgia Board of Community Health approved a health plan for state employees that will not cover abortion except in cases of life endangerment. Nineteen states now limit abortion coverage for state employees.

Other Major Abortion Restrictions

States adopted a wide range of other major abortion restrictions in 2013.

Parental Involvement. Three states enacted provisions designed to make it more difficult for minors to obtain abortions without parental involvement. Arkansas enacted a measure that makes it a crime to assist a minor in obtaining an abortion without parental consent, even if the procedure is performed in a state where parental involvement is not required. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D) allowed a parental consent requirement to go into effect without his signature; enforcement of the law is blocked pending a legal challenge. Oklahoma, which has long required parental consent and notification, adopted a measure that made the process for complying with the law more cumbersome by adding requirements such as documentation from parents proving parenthood. Finally, the Illinois Supreme Court cleared the way for the state’s 1995 parental notice law to go into effect, bringing the number of states requiring parental involvement before a minor receives an abortion to 39 (see State Policies on Parental Involvement in Minors’ Abortions).

Public Funding for Abortion. Iowa continued its policy of paying for abortions only in cases of life endangerment, rape, incest and fetal impairment. However, the state now requires the governor’s office to approve all instances where reimbursement is provided. Most states pay for abortion only in cases of life endangerment, rape or incest; Iowa is one of six states with a slightly broader standard see State Policies on State Funding of Abortion Under Medicaid). Seventeen states pay for all or most medically necessary abortions for low-income women (see Insurance Coverage of Abortion: Beyond the Exceptions for Life Endangerment, Rape and Incest).

Waiting Periods. South Dakota effectively extended its 72-hour waiting period by declaring that weekends and holidays could not be counted toward the requirement; this could extend the waiting period to a maximum of six days in some cases, giving the state the most restrictive waiting period requirement of the 26 such requirements in the country (see State Policies on Counseling and Waiting Periods).

Counseling. Ohio and Kansas expanded their existing counseling requirements. Ohio moved to require providers to test for a fetal heartbeat at least 24 hours before an abortion and inform the woman of the “statistical probability” of carrying the pregnancy to term if a fetal heartbeat is detected. Kansas enacted a measure requiring that abortion counseling materials include information on fetal pain, the risk of breast cancer and premature birth; the measure also delineates the exact text for written counseling materials (see State Policies on Counseling and Waiting Periods).

Ultrasound. Wisconsin and Indiana both adopted measures that require women to undergo an ultrasound prior to obtaining an abortion and listen to a detailed description of the image; the provider must offer her the option to view the image and listen to the heartbeat. Twenty-two states now regulate the provision of ultrasound by abortion providers (see State Policies on Requirements for Ultrasound).

Sex Selection and Genetic Impairment. Kansas, North Carolina and North Dakota enacted provisions criminalizing abortion for the purposes of sex selection. The North Dakota measure also prohibits the provision of an abortion because the fetus has been “diagnosed with either a genetic abnormality or the potential for a genetic abnormality.” This brings to six the number of states that ban abortion for purposes of sex selection, in line with a recent push by abortion opponents both in the U.S. and internationally (see A Problem-and-Solution Mismatch: Son Preference and Sex-Selective Abortion Bans).

Withholding Information. Kansas and Montana enacted laws that shield medical professionals from liability for withholding information that may have resulted in a woman obtaining an abortion.

State Employees. Kansas enacted a measure prohibiting state employees from participating in or facilitating abortions unless the procedure is performed outside of normal working hours at a facility not funded or operated by the state.

Refusal. A new law adopted in North Carolina allows any health care facility to refuse to provide abortion services; the previous law had allowed only hospitals to refuse. The law also expands the types of medical providers who may refuse to participate in an abortion to include professionals such as pharmacists, counselors and social workers, or their employees; previous law had applied only to physicians and nurses (see Refusing to Provide Health Services).

Family Planning

Twenty states enacted measures relating to access to family planning services in 2013, including measures that set funding levels, determine the types of providers eligible for funding and affect access to emergency contraception.

Family Planning Programs

Of the 17 states that passed budgets with line items for family planning funding, only Maine cut funding drastically; following on the heels of a 25% cut in 2012, the state slashed funds by an additional 33% in 2013. In contrast, New Hampshire reversed the 57% cut to family planning funding that had been adopted in 2011, restoring funds to their previous level. A similar attempt to reverse funding cuts in New Jersey came up short when Gov. Chris Christie (R) vetoed family planning funding for the fifth time.

Although family planning funding remained relatively stable in 2013, attempts to restrict family planning providers’ eligibility for state and federal funds continued apace. A new tiered system for determining priority for state and federal family planning funds in Ohio puts family planning providers at the bottom of a long list. A similar system in Oklahoma excludes specialized family planning providers not affiliated with health departments from receiving funds. Colorado, Kansas, Michigan and Texas re-enacted their existing restrictions, although the measure in Kansas is blocked due to a legal challenge. At year’s end 10 states have abortion-related restrictions on family planning providers (see State Family Planning Funding Restrictions).

Federal courts blocked measures enacted in Arizona and Indiana that would have excluded family planning providers who have any association with abortion services from being able to participate in the massive Medicaid program, citing that Medicaid patients have the right to seek treatment from the Medicaid provider of their choice (see Besieged Family Planning Network Plays Pivotal Role).

These injunctions cleared the way for abortion providers in Arizona and Indiana to be reimbursed for the family planning services they provide to Medicaid enrollees. In sharp contrast, Texas abolished its longstanding and successful federal-state family planning expansion after being told by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services that it was impermissible for the state to exclude providers who had some association with abortion. The state replaced it with a much smaller and entirely state-funded program (see State Medicaid Family Planning Eligibility Expansions).

Emergency Contraception

Hawaii enacted a new law requiring that a woman who has been sexually assaulted receive medically accurate and unbiased information on emergency contraception from the hospital treating her injuries. The law also requires the hospital to dispense the medication when requested by the woman. Hawaii is the 18th state to provide protections to women who have been sexually assaulted (see Emergency Contraception).

However, two states moved to restrict access to emergency contraception. In May, Oklahoma enacted a measure that would have required a minor younger than 17 to obtain a prescription to access the medication, despite the fact that the federal Food and Drug Administration ruled that minors of any age may obtain emergency contraception without a prescription; in August, a state court temporarily blocked enforcement of the measure. Also in 2013, Missouri passed a measure prohibiting the state from requiring pharmacies to carry prescription or nonprescription drugs or devices, including contraceptives, such as emergency contraception.

Sexually Transmitted Infections

In 2013, Hawaii, Nebraska and Vermont expanded access to treatment for STIs. Hawaii and Nebraska enacted provisions allowing health care practitioners to prescribe or dispense prescriptions for gonorrhea or chlamydia to a patient’s partner without first seeing the partner. Vermont, which had had a law allowing partner treatment for some STIs, enacted a new law expanding the conditions for which partner treatment is permitted. Twenty-eight states now explicitly permit treatment of a patient’s partner (see Partner Treatment for STIs).

Sex Education

Two states enacted measures to expand access to sex education in 2013. A new law in Colorado effectively prohibits abstinence-only instruction by requiring sex education in the state to be scientifically proven to delay sexual debut, reduce adolescents’ number of sexual partners, reduce the frequency of sex, and increase their contraceptive use. Illinois enacted three separate laws related to sex education. Although school districts can still decide for themselves whether to provide sex education, the new law requires any sex education that is taught in the state to be medically accurate and age-appropriate and include instruction on contraception and abstinence. The package also requires health education, which is mandatory for all school districts, to contain medically accurate information on abstinence as well as age-appropriate instruction on teen dating violence and child sexual abuse prevention. These new laws bring to nine the number of states requiring that the sex education provided in the state be medically accurate and include information on contraception (see State Policies in Brief: Sex and HIV Education.)

At the other end of the spectrum, new laws in North Carolina and Kansas could limit access to comprehensive and medically accurate sex education. A new law enacted in Kansas prohibits an individual who is associated in any way with an abortion provider from providing sex education. Meanwhile, a new law in North Carolina requires that sex education in the state must inform students that having an abortion increases the risk of a subsequent preterm birth. In Montana, Gov. Bullock (D) vetoed a measure that would have required parental consent for students participating in sex education.

Fetal Issues

Three states enacted laws regarding assault on pregnant women or fetal homicide. Arkansas adopted a measure allowing a fetus to be considered a victim of homicide at any point in gestation; a similar measure was allowed to go into effect in Montana without the governor’s signature. Instead of considering a fetus an independent victim, Colorado amended its statute criminalizing assault on a pregnant woman to include penalties for causing a pregnant woman to miscarry.

Pregnancy

Tennessee enacted a law requiring publicly funded substance abuse facilities to give preference to pregnant women, there are now 10 states that require facilities give pregnant women priority access (see Substance Abuse During Pregnancy). It also prohibits the state from filing for protective services for a newborn if a woman who is less than 20 weeks into her pregnancy seeks substance abuse treatment as part of prenatal care. (A similar bill in New Mexico was effectively vetoed when Gov. Susana Martinez (R) took no action on it.) Finally, the budget adopted in Indiana allocated $250,000 for “prenatal substance use and prevention.”

politifact7669,"Statement by the PresidentRose Garden

5:35 P.M. EDT

MR. BARDEN: Hello. My name is Mark Barden. Just four months ago, my wife Jackie and I lost our son, and our children, James and Natalie, they lost their little brother Daniel. Daniel was a first-grader at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Our sweet, 7-year-old Daniel was one of 20 children, six adults lost on December 14th. I have to say it feels like it was just yesterday.

In our deepest grief, we were supported by the love of our families and comforted by the love and prayers we received from millions of America, from every corner of the country.

What happened in Newtown can happen anywhere. In any instant, any dad in America could be in my shoes. No one should feel the pain. No one should feel our pain or the pain felt by the tens of thousands of people who’ve lost loved ones to senseless gun violence.

And that's why we're here. Two weeks ago, 12 of us from Newtown came to meet with U.S. senators and have a conversation about how to bring common-sense solutions to the issues of gun violence. We came with a sense of hope, optimistic that real conversation could begin that would ultimately save the lives of so many Americans. We met with dozens of Democrats and Republicans and shared with them pictures of our children, our spouses, our parents who lost their lives on December 14th.

Expanded background checks wouldn't have saved our loved ones, but still we came to support the bipartisan proposal from two senators, both with “A” ratings from the NRA -- a common-sense proposal supported by 90 percent of Americans. It‘s a proposal that will save lives without interfering with the rights of responsible, law-abiding gun owners.

We'll return home now, disappointed but not defeated. We return home with the determination that change will happen -- maybe not today, but it will happen. It will happen soon. We've always known this would be a long road, and we don't have the luxury of turning back. We will keep moving forward and build public support for common-sense solutions in the areas of mental health, school safety, and gun safety.

We take strength from the children and loved ones that we lost, and we carry a great faith in the American people.

On behalf of the Sandy Hook Promise, I would like to thank President Obama, Vice President Biden for their leadership and for standing strong and continuing to fight for a safer America. I would like to thank Senators Toomey, Manchin, Schumer and Kirk on coming together to seek common ground on legislation that would keep guns out of the hands of criminals and save lives.

And I would like to thank Connecticut’s Senators Blumenthal and Murphy. They’ve been right with us. They stood by us right from the very beginning. From the first few hours after this tragedy they were with us.

We will not be defeated. We are not defeated, and we will not be defeated. We are here now; we will always be here because we have no other choice. We are not going away. And every day, as more people are killed in this country because of gun violence, our determination grows stronger.

We leave Washington hoping that others, both here and across the country, will join us in making the Sandy Hook Promise, a pledge that we'd had great hope that more U.S. senators would take literally. I'd like to end by repeating the words with which the Sandy Hook Promise begins: Our hearts are broken. Our spirit is not.

Thank you. It is now my great pleasure to introduce the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama.

THE PRESIDENT: A few months ago, in response to too many tragedies -- including the shootings of a United States Congresswoman, Gabby Giffords, who’s here today, and the murder of 20 innocent schoolchildren and their teachers –- this country took up the cause of protecting more of our people from gun violence.

Families that know unspeakable grief summoned the courage to petition their elected leaders –- not just to honor the memory of their children, but to protect the lives of all our children. And a few minutes ago, a minority in the United States Senate decided it wasn’t worth it. They blocked common-sense gun reforms even while these families looked on from the Senate gallery.

By now, it’s well known that 90 percent of the American people support universal background checks that make it harder for a dangerous person to buy a gun. We’re talking about convicted felons, people convicted of domestic violence, people with a severe mental illness. Ninety percent of Americans support that idea. Most Americans think that's already the law.

And a few minutes ago, 90 percent of Democrats in the Senate just voted for that idea. But it’s not going to happen because 90 percent of Republicans in the Senate just voted against that idea.

A majority of senators voted “yes” to protecting more of our citizens with smarter background checks. But by this continuing distortion of Senate rules, a minority was able to block it from moving forward.

I’m going to speak plainly and honestly about what’s happened here because the American people are trying to figure out how can something have 90 percent support and yet not happen. We had a Democrat and a Republican -– both gun owners, both fierce defenders of our Second Amendment, with “A” grades from the NRA -- come together and worked together to write a common-sense compromise on background checks. And I want to thank Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey for their courage in doing that. That was not easy given their traditional strong support for Second Amendment rights.

As they said, nobody could honestly claim that the package they put together infringed on our Second Amendment rights. All it did was extend the same background check rules that already apply to guns purchased from a dealer to guns purchased at gun shows or over the Internet. So 60 percent of guns are already purchased through a background check system; this would have covered a lot of the guns that are currently outside that system.

Their legislation showed respect for gun owners, and it showed respect for the victims of gun violence. And Gabby Giffords, by the way, is both -- she’s a gun owner and a victim of gun violence. She is a Westerner and a moderate. And she supports these background checks.

In fact, even the NRA used to support expanded background checks. The current leader of the NRA used to support these background checks. So while this compromise didn’t contain everything I wanted or everything that these families wanted, it did represent progress. It represented moderation and common sense. That’s why 90 percent of the American people supported it.

But instead of supporting this compromise, the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill. They claimed that it would create some sort of “big brother” gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text. But that didn’t matter.

And unfortunately, this pattern of spreading untruths about this legislation served a purpose, because those lies upset an intense minority of gun owners, and that in turn intimidated a lot of senators. And I talked to several of these senators over the past few weeks, and they’re all good people. I know all of them were shocked by tragedies like Newtown. And I also understand that they come from states that are strongly pro-gun. And I have consistently said that there are regional differences when it comes to guns, and that both sides have to listen to each other.

But the fact is most of these senators could not offer any good reason why we wouldn’t want to make it harder for criminals and those with severe mental illnesses to buy a gun. There were no coherent arguments as to why we wouldn’t do this. It came down to politics -- the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections. They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment.

And obviously, a lot of Republicans had that fear, but Democrats had that fear, too. And so they caved to the pressure, and they started looking for an excuse -- any excuse -- to vote “no.”

One common argument I heard was that this legislation wouldn’t prevent all future massacres. And that’s true. As I said from the start, no single piece of legislation can stop every act of violence and evil. We learned that tragically just two days ago. But if action by Congress could have saved one person, one child, a few hundred, a few thousand -- if it could have prevented those people from losing their lives to gun violence in the future while preserving our Second Amendment rights, we had an obligation to try.

And this legislation met that test. And too many senators failed theirs.

I've heard some say that blocking this step would be a victory. And my question is, a victory for who? A victory for what? All that happened today was the preservation of the loophole that lets dangerous criminals buy guns without a background check. That didn’t make our kids safer. Victory for not doing something that 90 percent of Americans, 80 percent of Republicans, the vast majority of your constituents wanted to get done? It begs the question, who are we here to represent?

I've heard folks say that having the families of victims lobby for this legislation was somehow misplaced. ""A prop,"" somebody called them. “Emotional blackmail,” some outlet said. Are they serious? Do we really think that thousands of families whose lives have been shattered by gun violence don’t have a right to weigh in on this issue? Do we think their emotions, their loss is not relevant to this debate?

So all in all, this was a pretty shameful day for Washington.

But this effort is not over. I want to make it clear to the American people we can still bring about meaningful changes that reduce gun violence, so long as the American people don’t give up on it. Even without Congress, my administration will keep doing everything it can to protect more of our communities. We’re going to address the barriers that prevent states from participating in the existing background check system. We’re going to give law enforcement more information about lost and stolen guns so it can do its job. We’re going to help to put in place emergency plans to protect our children in their schools.

But we can do more if Congress gets its act together. And if this Congress refuses to listen to the American people and pass common-sense gun legislation, then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters.

To all the people who supported this legislation -- law enforcement and responsible gun owners, Democrats and Republicans, urban moms, rural hunters, whoever you are -- you need to let your representatives in Congress know that you are disappointed, and that if they don’t act this time, you will remember come election time.

To the wide majority of NRA households who supported this legislation, you need to let your leadership and lobbyists in Washington know they didn’t represent your views on this one.

The point is those who care deeply about preventing more and more gun violence will have to be as passionate, and as organized, and as vocal as those who blocked these common-sense steps to help keep our kids safe. Ultimately, you outnumber those who argued the other way. But they're better organized. They're better financed. They’ve been at it longer. And they make sure to stay focused on this one issue during election time. And that's the reason why you can have something that 90 percent of Americans support and you can't get it through the Senate or the House of Representatives.

So to change Washington, you, the American people, are going to have to sustain some passion about this. And when necessary, you’ve got to send the right people to Washington. And that requires strength, and it requires persistence.

And that's the one thing that these families should have inspired in all of us. I still don't know how they have been able to muster up the strength to do what they’ve doing over the last several weeks, last several months.

And I see this as just round one. When Newtown happened, I met with these families and I spoke to the community, and I said, something must be different right now. We’re going to have to change. That's what the whole country said. Everybody talked about how we were going to change something to make sure this didn't happen again, just like everybody talked about how we needed to do something after Aurora. Everybody talked about we needed change something after Tucson.

And I’m assuming that the emotions that we’ve all felt since Newtown, the emotions that we’ve all felt since Tucson and Aurora and Chicago -- the pain we share with these families and families all across the country who’ve lost a loved one to gun violence -- I’m assuming that's not a temporary thing. I’m assuming our expressions of grief and our commitment to do something different to prevent these things from happening are not empty words.

I believe we’re going to be able to get this done. Sooner or later, we are going to get this right. The memories of these children demand it. And so do the American people.

Thank you very much, everybody.

politifact4069,"Remarks by the President in Twitter Town Hall2:04 P.M. EDT



MR. DORSEY: Good afternoon and welcome to the White House. I am Jack Dorsey, from Twitter.



Through more than 200 million tweets per day, people around the world use Twitter to instantly connect to what's most meaningful to them. In every country -- Egypt and Japan, the UK and the United States -- much of this conversation is made up of everyday people engaging in spirited debate about the future of their countries.



Our partners at Salesforce Radian6 studied more than a million tweets, discussing our nation's politics over the recent weeks, and they found that America's financial security to be one of the most actively talked about topics on Twitter. They further found that President Obama's name comes up in more than half of these conversations.



And so today this vibrant discussion comes here to the White House and you get to ask the questions. To participate, just open your web browser and go to askObama.Twitter.com. Neither the President or I know the questions that will be asked today. That decision is driven entirely by the Twitter users.



And so let's get the conversation started. Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. (Applause.)



THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody! (Applause.) First of all, everybody can sit down. (Laughter.) It's much easier to tweet from a seated position. (Laughter.)



MR. DORSEY: And I understand you want to start the conversation off with a tweeter yourself.



THE PRESIDENT: I'm going to make history here as the first President to live tweet. So we've got a computer over here. (Types in tweet.)



MR. DORSEY: It's only 140 characters. (Laughter.)



THE PRESIDENT: All right, I think I have done this properly. But here's the test.



MR. DORSEY: And you tweeted.



THE PRESIDENT: How about that? Not bad. (Applause.) Thank you. So I think my question will be coming up at some point.



MR. DORSEY: So what was your question? Here it is.



THE PRESIDENT: Here's the question: ""In order to reduce the deficit, what costs would you cut and what investments would you keep?""



And the reason I thought this was an important question is, as all of you know, we are going through a spirited debate here in Washington, but it's important to get the whole country involved, in making a determination about what are the programs that can help us grow, can create jobs, improve our education system, maintain our clean air and clean water, and what are those things that are a waste that we shouldn’t be investing in because they're not helping us grow or create jobs or creating new businesses. And that debate is going to be heating up over the next couple of weeks, so I'd love to hear from the American people, see what thoughts they have.



MR. DORSEY: Excellent. Well, first question comes from a curator in New Hampshire. And we have eight curators around the country helping us pick tweets from the crowd so that we can read them to the President.



And this one comes from William Smith: ""What mistakes have you made in handling this recession and what would you do differently?""



THE PRESIDENT: That's a terrific question. When I first came into office we were facing the worst recession since the Great Depression. So, looking around this room, it's a pretty young room -- it's certainly the worst recession that we've faced in our lifetimes. And we had to act quickly and make some bold and sometimes difficult decisions.



It was absolutely the right thing to do to put forward a Recovery Act that cut taxes for middle-class folks so they had more money in their pocket to get through the recession. It was the right thing to do to provide assistance to states to make sure that they didn’t have to lay off teachers and cops and firefighters as quickly as they needed to. And it was the right thing to do to try to rebuild our infrastructure and put people back to work building roads and bridges and so forth.



It also was the right thing to do, although a tough decision, to save the auto industry, which is now profitable and gaining market share -- the U.S. auto industry -- for the first time in a very long time.



I think that -- probably two things that I would do differently. One would have been to explain to the American people that it was going to take a while for us to get out of this. I think even I did not realize the magnitude, because most economists didn’t realize the magnitude, of the recession until fairly far into it, maybe two or three months into my presidency where we started realizing that we had lost 4 million jobs before I was even sworn in.



And so I think people may not have been prepared for how long this was going to take and why we were going to have to make some very difficult decisions and choices. And I take responsibility for that, because setting people’s expectations is part of how you end up being able to respond well.



The other area is in the area of housing. I think that the continuing decline in the housing market is something that hasn’t bottomed out as quickly as we expected. And so that’s continued to be a big drag on the economy.



We’ve had to revamp our housing program several times to try to help people stay in their homes and try to start lifting home values up. But of all the things we’ve done, that’s probably been the area that’s been most stubborn to us trying to solve the problem.



MR. DORSEY: Mr. President, 27 percent of our questions are in the jobs category, as you can see from the screen over here. Our next question has to do about jobs and technology. It comes from David: ""Tech and knowledge industries are thriving, yet jobs discussion always centers on manufacturing. Why not be realistic about jobs?""



THE PRESIDENT: Well, it’s not an either/or question; it’s a both/and question. We have to be successful at the cutting-edge industries of the future like Twitter. But we also have always been a country that makes stuff. And manufacturing jobs end up having both higher wages typically, and they also have bigger multiplier effects. So one manufacturing job can support a range of other jobs -- suppliers and the restaurant near the plant and so forth. So they end up having a substantial impact on the overall economy.



What we want to focus on is advanced manufacturing that combines new technology, so research and development to figure out how are we going to create the next Twitter, how are we going to create the next Google, how are we going to create the next big thing -- but make sure that production is here.



So it’s great that we have an Apple that’s creating iPods, iPads and designing them and creating the software, but it would be nice if we’re also making the iPads and the iPods here in the United States, because that's some more jobs that people can work at.



And there are going to be a series of decisions that we’ve got to make. Number one, are we investing in research and development in order to emphasize technology? And a lot of that has to come from government. That's how the Internet got formed. That's how GPS got formed. Companies on their own can’t always finance the basic research because they can’t be assured that they’re going to get a return on it.



Number two, we’ve got to drastically improve how we train our workforce and our kids around math and science and technology.



Number three, we’ve got to have a top-notch infrastructure to support advanced manufacturing, and we’ve got to look at sectors where we know this is going to be the future. Something like clean energy, for example. For us not to be the leaders in investing in clean energy manufacturing so that wind turbines and solar panels are not only designed here in the United States but made here in the United States makes absolutely no sense. We’ve got to invest in those areas for us to be successful.



So you can combine high-tech with manufacturing, and then you get the best of all worlds.



MR. DORSEY: You mentioned education. There's a lot of questions coming about education and its impact on the economy. This one in particular is from a curator who is pulling from a student in Ohio, named Dustin: ""Higher ed is necessary for a stronger economy, but for some middle-class Americans it’s becoming too expensive. What can be done?""



THE PRESIDENT: Well, here is some good news. We’ve already done something that is very significant, and people may not know. As part of a higher education package that we passed last year, what we were able to do was to take away subsidies that were going to banks for serving as middlemen in the student loan program and funnel that to help young people, through Pell Grants and lower rates on student loans. And so there are millions of students who are getting more affordable student loans and grants as a consequence of the steps that we’ve already taken. This is about tens of billions of dollars' worth of additional federal dollars that were going to banks are now going to students directly.



In addition, what we’ve said is that starting in 2013, young people who are going to college will not have to pay more than 10 percent of their income in repayment. And that obviously helps to relieve the burden on a lot students -- because, look, I’m a guy who had about $60,000 worth of debt when I graduated from law school, and Michelle had $60,000. And so we were paying a bigger amount every month than our mortgage. And we did that for eight, 10 years. So I know how burdensome this can be.



I do think that the universities still have a role in trying to keep their costs down. And I think that it’s important -- even if we've got better student loan programs, more grants, if the costs keep on going up then we'll never have enough money, you'll never get enough help to avoid taking on these huge debts. And so working with university presidents to try to figure out, where can you cut costs -- of course, it may mean that the food in the cafeteria is a little worse and the gym is not as fancy. But I think all of us have to figure out a way to make sure that higher education is accessible for everybody.



One last point -- I know, Twitter, I’m supposed to be short. (Laughter.) But city -- community colleges is a huge, under-utilized resource, where what we want to do is set up a lifelong learning system where you may have gotten your four-year degree, but five years out you decide you want to go into another field or you want to brush up on new technologies that are going to help you advance. We need to create a system where you can conveniently access community colleges that are working with businesses to train for the jobs that actually exist. That’s a huge area where I think we can make a lot of progress.



MR. DORSEY: You mention debt a lot. That’s come up in conversation a lot recently, especially in some of our recent questions, specifically the debt ceiling. And this is formulated in our next question from RenegadeNerd out of Atlanta: ""Mr. President, will you issue an executive order to raise the debt ceiling pursuant to Section 4 of the 14th Amendment?""



THE PRESIDENT: Can I just say, RenegadeNerd, that picture is -- captures it all there. (Laughter.) He's got his hand over there, he’s looking kind of confused. (Laughter.)



Let me, as quickly as I can, describe what’s at stake with respect to the debt ceiling. Historically, the United States, whenever it has a deficit, it finances that deficit through the sale of treasuries. And this is a very common practice. Over our lifetimes, typically the government is always running a modest deficit. And Congress is supposed to vote on the amount of debt that Treasury can essentially issue. It’s a pretty esoteric piece of business; typically has not been something that created a lot of controversy.



What’s happening now is, is that Congress is suggesting we may not vote to raise the debt ceiling. If we do not, then the Treasury will run out of money. It will not be able to pay the bills that are owing, and potentially the entire world capital markets could decide, you know what, the full faith and credit of the United States doesn’t mean anything. And so our credit could be downgraded, interest rates could go drastically up, and it could cause a whole new spiral into a second recession, or worse.



So this is something that we shouldn’t be toying with. What Dexter’s question referred to was there are some people who say that under the Constitution, it’s unconstitutional for Congress not to allow Treasury to pay its bills and are suggesting that this should be challenged under the Constitution.



I don’t think we should even get to the constitutional issue. Congress has a responsibility to make sure we pay our bills. We’ve always paid them in the past. The notion that the U.S. is going to default on its debt is just irresponsible. And my expectation is, is that over the next week to two weeks, that Congress, working with the White House, comes up with a deal that solves our deficit, solves our debt problems, and makes sure that our full faith and credit is protected.



MR. DORSEY: So back to jobs. We have a question from New York City about immigrant entrepreneurs: ""Immigrant entrepreneurs can build companies and create jobs for U.S. workers. Will you support a startup visa program?""



THE PRESIDENT: What I want to do is make sure that talented people who come to this country to study, to get degrees, and are willing and interested in starting up businesses can do so, as opposed to going back home and starting those businesses over there to compete against the United States and take away U.S. jobs.



So we’re working with the business community as well as the entrepreneurial community to figure out are there ways that we can streamline the visa system so if you are studying here, you’ve got a PhD in computer science or you’ve got a PhD in engineering, and you say I’m ready to invest in the United States, create jobs in the United States, then we are able to say to you, we want you to stay here.



And I think that it is possible for us to deal with this problem. But it’s important for us to look at it more broadly. We’ve got an immigration system that’s broken right now, where too many folks are breaking the law but also our laws make it too hard for talented people to contribute and be part of our society. And we’ve always been a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. And so we need comprehensive immigration reform, part of which would allow entrepreneurs and high-skilled individuals to stay here -- because we want to be attracting that talent here. We don’t want that -- we don’t want to pay for training them here and then having them benefit other countries.



MR. DORSEY: Our next question was just -- was sent just an hour ago and touches on alternative energy and job creation: ""Will you focus on promoting alternative energy industries in oil states like Louisiana and Texas?""



THE PRESIDENT: I want to promote alternative energy everywhere, including oil states like Louisiana and Texas. This is something that I’m very proud of and doesn’t get a lot of attention. We made the largest investment in clean energy in our history through the Recovery Act. And so we put forward a range of programs that provided credits and grants to startup companies in areas like creating wind turbines, solar panels.



A great example is advanced battery manufacturing. When I came into office, advanced batteries, which are used, for example, in electric cars, we only accounted for 2 percent of the world market in advanced batteries. And we have quintupled our market share, or even gone further, just over the last two years. And we’re projecting that we can get to 30 to 40 percent of that market. That’s creating jobs all across the Midwest, all across America.



And whoever wins this race on advanced battery manufacturing is probably going to win the race to produce the cars of the 21st century. China is investing in it. Germany is investing in it. We need to be investing in it as well.



MR. DORSEY: I wanted to take a moment and point out the map just behind you. These are tweets coming in, in real time, and these are questions being asked right now. And it flips between the various categories that we’ve determined and also just general askObama questions.



So our next question is coming up on the screen now, from Patrick: “Mr. President, in several states we have seen people lose their collective bargaining rights. Do you have a plan to rectify this?""



THE PRESIDENT: The first thing I want to emphasize is that collective bargaining is the reason why the vast majority of Americans enjoy a minimum wage, enjoy weekends, enjoy overtime. So many things that we take for granted are because workers came together to bargain with their employers.



Now, we live in a very competitive society in the 21st century. And that means in the private sector, labor has to take management into account. If labor is making demands that make management broke and they can’t compete, then that doesn’t do anybody any good.



In the public sector, what is true is that some of the pension plans that have been in place and the health benefits that are in place are so out of proportion with what’s happening in the private sector that a lot of taxpayers start feeling resentful. They say, well, if I don’t have health care where I only have to pay $1 for prescription drugs, why is it that the person whose salary I’m paying has a better deal?



What this means is, is that all of us are going to have to make some adjustments. But the principle of collective bargaining, making sure that people can exercise their rights to be able to join together with other workers and to negotiate and kind of even the bargaining power on either side, that’s something that has to be protected. And we can make these adjustments in a way that are equitable but preserve people’s collective bargaining rights.



So, typically, the challenges against bargaining rights have been taking place at the state level. I don't have direct control over that. But what I can do is to speak out forcefully for the principle that we can make these adjustments that are necessary during these difficult fiscal times, but do it in a way that preserves collective bargaining rights. And certainly at the federal level where I do have influence, I can make sure that we make these adjustments without affecting people’s collective bargaining rights.



I'll give you just one example. We froze federal pay for federal workers for two years. Now, that wasn’t real popular, as you might imagine, among federal workers. On the other hand, we were able to do that precisely because we wanted to prevent layoffs and we wanted to make sure that we sent a signal that everybody is going to have to make some sacrifices, including federal workers.



By the way, people who work in the White House, they’ve had their pay frozen since I came in, our high-wage folks. So they haven’t had a raise in two and a half years, and that's appropriate, because a lot of ordinary folks out there haven’t, either. In fact, they’ve seen their pay cut in some cases.



MR. DORSEY: Mr. President, 6 percent of our questions are coming in about housing, which you can see in the graph behind me. And this one in particular has to do with personal debt and housing: “How will admin work to help underwater homeowners who aren’t behind in payments but are trapped in homes they can’t sell?” From Robin.



THE PRESIDENT: This is a great question. And remember, I mentioned one of our biggest challenges during the course of the last two and a half years has been dealing with a huge burst of the housing bubble.



What's happened is a lot of folks are underwater, meaning their home values went down so steeply and so rapidly that now their mortgage, the amount they owe, is a lot more than the assessed worth of their home. And that obviously burdens a lot of folks. It means if they’re selling, they’ve got to sell at a massive loss that they can’t afford. It means that they don’t feel like they have any assets because the single biggest asset of most Americans is their home.



So what we’ve been trying to do is to work with the issuers of the mortgages, the banks or the service companies, to convince them to work with homeowners who are paying, trying to do the right thing, trying to stay in their homes, to see if they can modify the loans so that their payments are lower, and in some cases, maybe even modify their principal, so that they don’t feel burdened by these huge debts and feel tempted to walk away from homes that actually they love and where they’re raising their families.



We’ve made some progress. We have, through the programs that we set up here, have probably seen several million home modifications either directly because we had control of the loan process, or because the private sector followed suit. But it’s not enough. And so we’re going back to the drawing board, talking to banks, try to put some pressure on them to work with people who have mortgages to see if we can make further adjustments, modify loans more quickly, and also see if there may be circumstances where reducing principal is appropriate.



MR. DORSEY: And our next question comes from someone you may know. This is Speaker Boehner.



THE PRESIDENT: Oh, there you go. (Laughter.)



MR. DORSEY: “After embarking on a record spending binge that left us deeper in debt, where are the jobs?” And I want to note that these characters are his fault. (Laughter.)



THE PRESIDENT: First of all --



MR. DORSEY: Not his fault, not his fault.



THE PRESIDENT: -- John obviously needs to work on his typing skills. (Laughter.) Well, look, obviously John is the Speaker of the House, he’s a Republican, and so this is a slightly skewed question. (Laughter.) But what he’s right about is that we have not seen fast enough job growth relative to the need. I mean, we lost, as I said, 4 million jobs before I took office, before I was sworn in. About 4 million jobs were lost in the few months right after I took office before our economic policies had a chance to take any effect.



And over the last 15 months, we’ve actually seen two million jobs created in the private sector. And so we’re each month seeing growth in jobs, But when you’ve got a 8 million dollar -- 8-million-job hole and you’re only filling it 100,000-200,000 jobs at a time each month, obviously that’s way too long for a lot of folks who are still out of work.



There are a couple of things that we can continue to do. I actually worked with Speaker Boehner to pass a payroll tax cut in December that put an extra $1,000 in the pockets of almost every single American. That means they’re spending money. That means that businesses have customers. And that has helped improve overall growth.



We have provided at least 16 tax cuts to small businesses who have needed a lot of help and have been struggling, including, for example, saying zero capital gains taxes on startups -- because our attitude is we want to encourage new companies, young entrepreneurs, to get out there, start their business, without feeling like if they’re successful in the first couple of years that somehow they have to pay taxes, as opposed to putting that money back into their business.



So we’ve been able to cooperate with Republicans on a range of these issues. There are some areas where the Republicans have been more resistant in cooperating, even though I think most objective observers think it’s the right thing to do. I’ll give you a specific example.



It’s estimated that we have about $2 trillion worth of infrastructure that needs to be rebuilt. Roads, bridges, sewer lines, water mains; our air traffic control system doesn’t make sense. We don’t have the kind of electric grid that’s smart, meaning it doesn’t waste a lot of energy in transmission. Our broadband system is slower than a lot of other countries.



For us to move forward on a major infrastructure initiative where we’re putting people to work right now -- including construction workers who were disproportionately unemployed when the housing bubble went bust -- to put them to work rebuilding America at a time when interest rates are very low, contractors are looking for work, and the need is there, that is something that could make a huge, positive impact on the economy overall. And it’s an example of making an investment now that ends up having huge payoffs down the road.



We haven’t gotten the kind of cooperation that I’d like to see on some of those ideas and initiatives. But I’m just going to keep on trying and eventually I’m sure the Speaker will see the light. (Laughter.)



MR. DORSEY: Speaking of startups, there’s a ton of questions about small businesses and how they affect job creation. This one comes from Neal: “Small biz create jobs. What incentives are you willing to support to improve small business growth?”



THE PRESIDENT: Well, I just mentioned some of the tax breaks that we’ve provided not only to small businesses, but also in some cases were provided big businesses. For example, if they’re making investments in plants and equipment this year, they can fully write down those costs, take -- essentially depreciate all those costs this year and that saves them a pretty big tax bill. So we’re already initiating a bunch of steps.



The biggest challenge that I hear from small businesses right now actually has to do with financing, because a lot of small businesses got their financing from community banks. Typically, they’re not getting them from the big Wall Street banks, but they’re getting them from their various regional banks in their communities. A lot of those banks were pretty over-extended in the commercial real estate market, which has been hammered. A lot of them are still digging themselves out of bad loans that they made that were shown to be bad during the recession.



And so, what we’ve tried to do is get the Small Business Administration, the federal agency that helps small businesses, to step in and to provide more financing -- waiving fees, seeing if we can lower interest rates in some cases, making sure that the threshold for companies that qualify for loans are more generous. And that’s helped a lot of small businesses all across the country. And this is another example of where, working with Congress, my hope is, is that we can continue to provide these tax incentives and maybe do even a little bit more.



Q Our next question was tweeted less than five minutes ago and comes to us from Craig: “My question is, can you give companies a tax break if they hire an honorable discharged veteran?”



THE PRESIDENT: This is something that I’ve been talking a lot about internally. We’ve got all these young people coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan; have made incredible sacrifices; have taken on incredible responsibilities. You see some 23-year-old who's leading a platoon in hugely dangerous circumstances, making decisions, operating complex technologies. These are folks who can perform. But, unfortunately, what we’re seeing is that a lot of these young veterans have a higher unemployment rate than people who didn’t serve. And that makes no sense.



So what we’d like to do is potentially combine a tax credit for a company that hires veterans with a campaign to have private companies step up and do the right thing and hire more veterans. And one of the things that we’ve done is internally in the federal government we have made a huge emphasis on ramping up our outreach to veterans and the hiring of veterans, and this has been a top priority of mine. The notion that these guys who are sacrificing for our freedom and our security end up coming home and not being able to find a job I think is unacceptable.



MR. DORSEY: Mr. President, this next question comes from someone else you may recognize. And what's interesting about this question, it was heavily retweeted and voted up by our userbase. This comes from NickKristof: “Was it a mistake to fail to get Republicans to commit to raise the debt ceiling at the same time tax cuts were extended?”



THE PRESIDENT: Nicholas is a great columnist. But I have to tell you the assumption of the question is, is that I was going to be able to get them to commit to raising the debt ceiling.



In December, we were in what was called the lame duck session. The Republicans knew that they were going to be coming in as the majority. We only had a few short weeks to deal with a lot of complicated issues, including repealing ""don't ask, don't tell,"" dealing with a START treaty to reduce nuclear weapons, and come to terms with a budget. And what we were able to do was negotiate a package where we agreed to do something that we didn’t like but that the Republicans badly wanted, which is to extend the Bush tax cuts on the wealthy for another two years.



In exchange, we were able to get this payroll tax that put $1,000 -- tax cut that put $1,000 in the pockets of every American, which would help economic growth and jobs. We were also able to get unemployment insurance extended for the millions of Americans out there who are still out of work and whose benefits were about to run out. And that was a much better deal than I think a lot of people expected.



It would have been great if we were able to also settle this issue of the debt ceiling at that time. That wasn’t the deal that was available. But here’s the more basic point: Never in our history has the United States defaulted on its debt. The debt ceiling should not be something that is used as a gun against the heads of the American people to extract tax breaks for corporate jet owners, or oil and gas companies that are making billions of dollars because the price of gasoline has gone up so high.



I’m happy to have those debates. I think the American people are on my side on this. What we need to do is to have a balanced approach where everything is on the table. We need to reduce corporate loopholes. We need to reduce discretionary spending on programs that aren’t working. We need to reduce defense spending. Everything has -- we need to look at entitlements, and we have to say, how do we protect and preserve Medicare and Social Security for not just this generation but also future generations. And that’s going to require some modifications, even as we maintain its basic structure.



So what I’m hoping to see over the next couple of weeks is people put their dogmas aside, their sacred cows aside; they come together and they say, here’s a sensible approach that reduces our deficit, makes sure that government is spending within its means, but also continues to make investments in education, in clean energy, and basic research that are going to preserve our competitive advantage going forward.



MR. DORSEY: So speaking of taxes, our next question is coming from us -- from Alabama, from Lane: ""What changes to the tax system do you think are necessary to help solve the deficit problem and for the system to be fair?""



THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think that, first of all, it’s important for people to realize that since I’ve been in office I’ve cut taxes for middle-class families, repeatedly. The Recovery Act cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. The payroll tax cut that we passed in December put an extra thousand dollars in the pockets of every family in America.



And so we actually now have the lowest tax rates since the 1950s. Our tax rates are lower now than they were under Ronald Reagan. They’re lower than they were under George Bush -- senior or George Bush, junior. They’re lower than they were under Bill Clinton.



The question is how do we pay for the things that we all think are important and how do we make sure that the tax system is equitable? And what I’ve said is that in addition to eliminating a whole bunch of corporate loopholes that are just not fair -- the notion that corporate jets should get a better deal than commercial jets, or the notion that oil and gas companies that made tens of billions of dollars per quarter need an additional break to give them an incentive to go drill for oil -- that doesn’t make sense.



But what I’ve also said is people like me who have been incredibly fortunate, mainly because a lot of folks bought my book -- (laughter) -- for me to be able to go back to the tax rate that existed under Bill Clinton, to pay a couple of extra percentage points so that I can make sure that seniors still have Medicare or kids still have Head Start, that makes sense to me. And, Jack, we haven’t talked about this before, but I’m assuming it makes sense t",0
politifact15123,"Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on FDA’s ongoing efforts to help improve effectiveness of influenza vaccinesFor Immediate Release: February 26, 2018 Statement From: Statement Author Leadership Role Commissioner of Food and Drugs - Food and Drug Administration Scott Gottlieb M.D.

Español

The current influenza season has been especially difficult, causing widespread illness that has affected all fifty states and resulted in a record number of hospitalizations. While healthcare professionals continue to combat this year’s flu – which may continue to affect Americans into April – we’re already partnering with other public health agencies to conduct essential work to produce next season’s influenza vaccines.

As part of this process, we’re striving to better understand why we saw reduced effectiveness of this year’s influenza vaccines against one strain of influenza A, called H3N2. It was this strain that caused much of the influenza-related illness this flu season. Moreover, this year is not the first time we have seen vaccines be less effective against this particular strain of influenza, H3N2.

As such, we are taking a number of actions to better understand why effectiveness tends to be lower against the H3N2 strain and what we can do about it. By looking closely at the available data and applying the lessons we learn each flu season to the vaccine development process, we offer the greatest chance of developing vaccines that even more effectively prevent the flu in the future.

These lessons may be applied not only to enhancing the most prevalent process for developing influenza vaccine in eggs, but to considering whether greater investment in alternative processes such as cell-based or recombinant approaches to vaccine development are required. With this statement, I want to outline what we’ve learned so far about this season’s vaccines and the steps we’re taking and plan to take to determine the root cause of this year’s findings and better prepare for future flu seasons.

Reduced effectiveness of 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines against H3N2

There are a number of theories on why this season’s vaccines produced reduced effectiveness against H3N2. We’re taking steps to investigate each of these potential causes, rule out possible reasons for the variation in effectiveness and improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Overall, preliminary vaccine effectiveness reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for H3N2 influenza was 25 percent, which means that people who received the vaccine were 25 percent less likely to be sick and need to see a doctor.

While that finding isn’t too far off from the vaccine effectiveness seen against H3N2 in previous years, we need to take new steps to improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Of note, the effectiveness of the vaccine against H3N2 in children 6 months to 8 years of age was 51 percent this season, yet the effectiveness in those 65 years and older was only 17 percent, and the effectiveness in older children and adults under 65 years of age was even lower. The vaccines did do much better for other viruses that are also causing the flu this season. The data show that overall vaccine effectiveness for H1N1 and influenza B was 67 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for all age groups combined.

So why did this season’s vaccines not deliver higher protection against H3N2? And why have vaccines in prior seasons when H3N2 circulated, also delivered reduced protection against this particular flu strain?

We don’t think it was a question of getting the particular H3N2 strain wrong when we set out to produce this season’s flu vaccines. Although adapting circulating virus strains for manufacture can lead to differences between the circulating strain and the one used for manufacturing that could affect effectiveness, so far the data we have suggests that the viruses provided by reference laboratories to manufacturers to make this year’s vaccines do reasonably match the circulating flu strains that are causing most of the illnesses, including H3N2.

However, we’re working with our colleagues at CDC and other federal agencies to examine and address other factors that might be contributing to the less than optimal overall protection provided by this season’s vaccines against influenza. We would particularly like to understand why vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 influenza year-to-year tends to be lower than effectiveness against other influenza viruses.

Working to determine the root causes

Toward these ends, scientists at FDA are collaborating with colleagues at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to use a large database that includes details of the flu vaccines administered to four million individuals along with whether they were hospitalized for influenza or treated with antiviral medications for influenza-like illness. This work, which is still underway, will try to better understand why overall effectiveness with both the cell-based and egg-based vaccines was less than optimal. We’re also looking at the difference in effectiveness in people 65 years and older who were vaccinated with high-dose influenza vaccine and adjuvanted influenza vaccine to see if effectiveness was better than in those vaccinated with standard dose vaccines. The adjuvanted influenza vaccine contains an ingredient meant to boost the immune system’s response to the vaccine while high dose vaccines contain four times as much of the influenza material or antigen as standard vaccines. What we learn about the differences in efficacy between these different vaccines might reveal information that can inform why overall effectiveness against H3N2 was lagging.

What might this information reveal? One theory is that people might require a higher amount of H3N2 antigen to elicit a proper immune response to that particular strain of influenza. As I noted previously, the work conducted with CMS shows a preliminary finding that suggests the cell-based influenza vaccine might be somewhat more effective than the egg-based vaccine. We are working to follow up on that finding. We’re also combing through the data to see if there are other reasons for why this season’s vaccines were less effective against H3N2. Our scientists are currently working internally and collaborating with others inside and outside of the federal government to understand all of these findings.

The knowledge we gain through such scientific research will allow us to determine if we need to change recommendations to vaccine manufacturers for how future season’s vaccines should be produced.

Looking ahead to the 2018-2019 flu season

While this scientific work is underway, the composition of next season’s flu vaccines will be the subject of an FDA advisory committee meeting March 1, 2018. As is done every year, the FDA convenes this panel to consider the recommendations made by the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the composition of influenza vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere, and to help the FDA select strains for next season’s flu vaccines in the U.S. WHO has recommended changing two of the strains currently contained in this year’s influenza vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere. The upcoming FDA advisory committee meeting will determine if these recommendations should also apply for the U.S. Following that meeting, the FDA will also work to apply all the knowledge that we gain from this year’s flu season to ensure that the best possible vaccines are available next season to protect against the flu.

In the meantime, this flu season isn’t over yet, though CDC data shows a decline in visits to doctor’s offices and outpatient clinics. We must continue to be diligent in doing our part to prevent the spread of flu however possible, including remembering to wash your hands frequently and staying home when you are sick. It’s also not too late get vaccinated if you have not yet done so, given that we are starting to see a larger proportion of illnesses caused by H1N1 and B influenza for which vaccines offer better protection. Vaccinations have also been shown to reduce the severity of the flu in people who get sick. People who are very sick with flu-like symptoms and those who are at high risk of serious flu complications should see a healthcare professional as soon as possible to see if they should be treated with antiviral drugs.

The FDA remains committed to determining the root cause for the shortcomings observed in the effectiveness of this season’s flu vaccine against H3N2, notifying the public of our work as we gain new insights, and applying what we learn to future vaccine development. Our aim is to make sure we continue to improve the effectiveness of future flu vaccines, and encourage more people to seek vaccination.

The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.
